Data recovery is the process of restoring data that has been lost accidentally, deleted, corrupted, or made inaccessible. Database recovery is the process of restoring the database to the most recent consistent state that existed before the failure.


## Different methods of database recovery



*   Undoing: if a transaction crashes, they can be undone so that none of the data is lost
*   Caching/buffering: a record of the data is saved and restored
*   Backups: databases can be backed up and stored in a different location from the original
*   Hardware repair: in order to effectively recover all the data
*   Overwritten data: if the data has been replaced by other data accidentally


## Situations in which recovery happens



*   Human error, accidental deletion
*   Malicious activity
*   Power outages
*   Malfunctions
*   Logical errors
*   Physical damage to drive
*   Corrupt files: the hard disk can become unreadable due to damage of the file system or media errors


## Issues relating to cost of data recovery systems and importance of data



*   Effects are worse for large businesses in which the data is crucial for the business
*   For smaller data storage devices such as pen drives, data loss might not be that important as the data was not very important
*   Hard disk drive repair: depends on cost, and how much data there is to recover
*   Big firms, banks, businesses will pay for the data to be recovered
*   Creation of a backup: which is not as expensive
*   Recovery via software solution: depends on how much data is recovered
*   File repair does not take much money and is cheaper
