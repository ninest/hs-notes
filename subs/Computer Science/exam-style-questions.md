    14. Outline why packet switching helps provide better security and is less likely to be affected by network failure
        *   Better security
            *   Data is not sent all together
            *   But is divided/sent in separate packets
            *   Each packet is formatted, addressed, and routed
            *   Packets sent by different routes
            *   Making the complete message more difficult to intercept
        *   Less likely to be affected by network failure
            *   Individual packets can be sent by different routes
            *   So if one route is down, others can be used

1. Sate the BigO efficient of sequential and binary search
    *   O(n)
    *   O(log n)
2. Define syntax and semantics in relation to programming languages
    *   syntax: the rules of the structure (creation) of a programming language
    *   semantics: the interpretation or meaning of the statements in a programming language
3. State tasks performed by a compiler
    *   translates HLL to machine code
    *   generates error messages
    *   accesses built-in routines provided by HLL used
    *   creates a separate machine language program
    *   performs lexical analysis
    *   performs syntactical analysis
4. Explain why subroutines are easier [1]
    *   Can be **written** independently
    *   Can be **tested** independently
    *   Can be used many times
5. Compare internal and external sorting
    *   internal sorting methods allow a set of data to be sorted by loading data into primary memory and applying sorting algorithm there
    *   external sorting is needed when the data is too large for the available primary memory space
    *   sorting takes place by loading subsets of the data into primary memory to be sorted
6. Outline differences between a compiler and an interpreter
    *   an interpreter converts a single instruction to machine code before execution takes place
    *   a compiler creates a separate machine code version of the entire program while an interpreter does not
    *   to execute a compiled program, the compiler does not need to be in the primary memory while the execution of an interpreted program requires the interpreter to be located in the primary memory at all times
    *   with a compiler, a program only needs to be translated once, whereas with an interpreter it needs to translate every time used
7. Identify features of a computer language
    *   fixed vocabulary
    *   unambiguous meaning
    *   consistent grammar and syntax
    *   provide a way to define basic data types and operations on those types (ability to write functions/procedures)

## Abstract data structures


### Short questions



1. Define recursion [2]
    *   Function that calls itself
2. Describe the characteristics of a
    *   Queue
        *   FIFO data structure
        *   Items can be added only to rear/tail and removed from front/head
3. Compare the use of a linked list with an array to store an process the daily sales in a business [3]
    *   size/length of a static array is predetermined/fixed, and the size of a linked list can be changed, it depends on the memory available
    *   Linked list can be expanded to suite the daily sales
    *   Each item in a static array can be directly accessed whilst access to the items in linked list is sequential
    *   And searching for a given item in linked list is slower, as it cannot be searches for using binary search
4. Explain benefits of using BST compared to stack when searching for a specific item [3]
    *   Time efficiency
        *   Data in BST is ordered
        *   Such that as each node is checked for the item, half the remaining nodes are ignored
        *   While all the elements in the stack have to be checked
        *   So for large data sets, stacks may be inefficient as compared to BST
    *   Memory efficiency
        *   Each element on the stack has to be removed to be checked
        *   When item is found, the stack’s contents will be changed
        *   But when the element is found in the BST, the contents are not removed from the BST
        *   So there is no need to create an additional copy of the BST, but a copy of a stack needs to be created
5. Explain how elements in the stack may be reversed using a quee [4]
    *   Create an empty queue
    *   While stack is not empty
        *   Pop an element from the stack
        *   Enqueue the popped element
    *   While queue is not empty
        *   Dequeue
        *   Push dequeued element back on the stack
6. Compare a binary tree to a linked list in terms of searching and storage required [4]
    *   A binary tree is faster and more efficient at searching as it can make use of **binary search**
    *   A singly linked list is slower and less efficient as it is a **linear/sequential** data structure
    *   More storage is required in a binary tree as it requires two pointers, and less storage is required for a singly linked list as it requires only one pointer
7. Outline why recursive solutions can be memory intensive [2]
    *   Recursive call involves use of stacks
    *   For storing/pushing data
    *   If many recursive calls are made, memory usage can be very large
8. Explain why a stack was used in the game [2]
    *   LIFO structure
    *   In game, allows “undo” function so movements can be retraced
9. Outline one advantage of making the queue dynamic [2]
    *   Dynamic queue would not have fixed size
    *   Memory is allocated as required/there is always sufficient memory to accommodate the queue

    *   Provide **software emulation**/virtualization of other OSs
    *   While hiding/abstracting physical environment/OS/execution environment of host machine
    *   Do not directly correspond to any real platform so software may be tested/executed on any platform=
    *   Software to be tested is compiled into the language of the virtual machine, and this is interpreted into the language of the host machine
2. Explain two functions that an operating system needs to perform in relation to multitasking [4]
    *   Memory management:
        *   OS allows more than one process to share memory
        *   By allocating separate memory to each program
        *   Provides memory isolation for each process
    *   Processor management
        *   To allow **appearance of more than one program running at the same time**
        *   By allocation of time slices
        *   Decides which process runs at a certain point in time
        *   Arranges the execution of applications so that you believe that there are several things happening at once
        *   Prioritizes tasks by importance
3. Describe how memory management of an OS prevents the system from crashing when more than one program is run at the same time [2]
    *   OS allocates and deallocates specific sections of memory to each program/module
    *   Ensures that the memory assigned to one program is not overwritten
    *   Uses secondary/virtual memory to allow more processes to run simultaneously
4. Outline the use of paging in relation to virtual memory [2]
    *   Paging allows similar-sized sections of data
    *   Identified by specific addresses
    *   To be swapped between RAM and secondary memory/storage
5. Explain the consequences of 1GB RAM on a multimedia game laptop [3]
    *   Software required more RAM to run efficiently
    *   Paging would be regularly used
    *   In order to load required modules
    *   Slowing down operation of laptop
    *   Laptop does not have dedicated graphics processor
    *   Results in low graphics
