## Forward


### Henrik Ibsen (author)



*   After marrying and having children, he felt that rather than merely living together, the husband and wife should live as equals, free to become their own human beings
*   However, critics attacked him for failing to respect the institution of marriage
*   His writing created sensitive social issues and the Norwegian society frowned upon his work at first
*   Father of Modern theater, he set out to develop serious ideas in a dramatic form


### Context



*   Set in Victorian Norway in 1879
*   The protagonist is very much like a real life character, as we see her slowly transform into a new character (metamorphosis)
*   By the end of the play, she is a woman fighting for her opinions and against her conventional husband: this makes her a complex character


## Elements


### Characters


#### Nora Helmer



*   The protagonist of the play, she initially seems like a playful **naïve** child who lacks knowledge from the outside world, although we see later that she has experience of the outer world
*   Her first word is “Hide”
    *   This gives the audience an idea of her personality in nature of being secretive
*   The **act of rebellion** with the macaroons indicates that she is **not** as innocent as she appears
    *   The simple lie about eating the macaroons shows that she will lie when she needs to in order to escape certain situations
*   She has a great **zest** (enthusiasm and energy): she takes pleasure in the Christmas tree, the taste of macaroons, and champagne
    *   She is physically **expressive and at ease**, frequently kissing Helmer and playing affectionately with her children
    *   Her instinct is to reach out to people, and we do see her reach out to the nurse, Mrs Linde, and Dr Rank
*   When we see her tarantella performance, we see she is a natural performer, turning to dance as a means of **expressing what she cannot say** (because societal constructs prevent her), and this draws awareness that she is **‘performing’** the role of wife which society has scripted for her
    *   Later in the play, she starts to feel a resentment that she has to perform in order to ask Helmer for anything, and she realizes that she is not in an **equal marriage**
    *   Later in the play, she is able to see her position in the marriage with an increasing clarity and finds the **strength** and **agency** to free herself from the oppressive position
*   At the start of the play, she responds affectionaley to Torvald’s teasing and is excited about the extra money she will get; she does not mind her doll-like existence in which she is pampered and patronized
    *   But as the play progresses, we learn that she is not just a “**silly girl**” like Torvald calls her and she understands what business is
    *   She is more **clever and manipulative** than Helmer thinks.
*   The fact that Torvald is alive indicates that she is more intelligent that Torvald thinks she is, and her description of her secret labor undertaken to pay off her debt shows her **determination and ambition** to protect herself and her husband (protecting her husband from being in debt to her)
    *   However, she is **naïve** in the sense that she thinks that the law will understand her motivation
    *   But it remains: the fact that she was willing to break the law in order to ensure Torvald’s health shows her courage and love for him
    *   However, later we learn that this **love is not mutual**, which is why she decides to leave him
*   At the start, she does not know that she is participating in an **unequal** marriage
    *   It is clear to the audience that the marriage is unequal as she does not even have a key to enter the house
    *   Furthermore, she is reluctant to open or knock on the door of Helmer’s study, implying that she does not have a full access to the house
*   Krogstad’s blackmail do not change Nora’s nature, rather they open her up to her unfulfilled and underappreciated potential: “I have been performing tricks for you, Torvald”; she has pretended to be someone she is not to fulfill the role that Torvald, her father, and the society have expected of her
*   Nora’s **awakening** is complete with Tolvald's severe and selfish reaction after learning her deception and forgery; it is the final catalyst
    *   Although this marks her awakening, she has been defying Torvald in small yet meaningful ways (eating macaroons then lying), which eventually led up to her making her own decision of leaving
    *   As audience, we already know that she is capable of defying authorities in small ways (as she ate the macaroons)
*   At the end of the play, there is a slight role reversal: at the start, Nora was expected to ask Torvald Helmer whether he could do anything
    *   But at the end, we see Helmer begging her to stay as she leaves.
*   For Nora, the main growth is her process of **self-discovery** as she transitions from a flighty girl in Act 1 to a sober figure seated at the table with Helmer in Act 3
*   At the end, she finally understands that her husband has made her into an object to be played with and to be molded to their own liking: her personality has been largely constructed by others, and she has become an object to be played with or looked at, and she decides to shape a new herself
*   Nora has emerged from a “silly” and weak girl to a feminist hero, more aware of her position in the household and in the society
    *   She starts off by revealing her childish qualities, but as the play progresses, she proves that she is not just a silly, childish women; she is a strong, courageous, and valiant character, capable of adapting to change
*   At the end when Torvald tells her that she must be a mother, she replies by saying that she is first and foremost a human being, hence she decided to make a decision that will benefit her she has been oppressed


#### Torvald Helmer



*   Nora’s husband, who is happy with his new position at the bank, as he has authority
*   He treats Nora **patronizingly** like a child and does not view her as an equal, but rather as a **doll** that he can play with and tease
*   He is overly concerned with his place and **status** in the society, and he allows his emotions to be swayed heavily by the prospect of society’s respect and the fear of society’s scorn
*   He believes that a man’s role in marriage is to protect and guide the wife, and clearly enjoys that Nora needs his guidance, and hence he interacts with her as if he is her father rather than an equal husband
*   He **instructs** her by saying “A home that depends on loans and debt is not beautiful because it is not free”, almost sounding like he is trying to **force his opinions** on her, and he also teaches Nora the dance and likes to envision himself as Nora’s saviour: “do you know that I’ve often wished you were facing some terrible dangers so that I could risk life and limb, risk everything, for your sake?”
*   Although he seizes power in the relationship and refers to Nora as a “girl”, it seems that Torvald is actually the weaker and more **childlike** character
    *   This is clear with Dr. Rank’s explanation for not wanting Torvald to enter is sickroom: “Torvald is so fastidious, he can't face up to anything ugly”; Dr Rank fears Torvald must be **sheltered** like a child from the **realities** of the world
    *   Furthermore, his decision to fire Krogstad stems ultimately from the fact that he feels threatened and offended by Krogstad’s failure to pay him proper respect.
*   He is very conscious of other **people’s perceptions** of him and of standing up in the community; his explanation for rejecting Nora’s request that Krogstad be kept on at the office is that it would make him “a laughing stock before the entire staff
    *   This demonstrates that he prioritizes his reputation over his wife’s desires
    *   Additionally, he further indicates his deep **need for society’s respect** in his reaction to Nora’s deception: although he says that Nora has ruined his happiness and will not be allowed to raise the children, he insists that she remain in the house because of his concern in saving “**the appearance**” of their household.
*   He enjoys **objectifying** his wife and showing off her beauty: he tells Dr Rank “worth seeing, if you ask me!”, and Nora tells Mrs Linde that Helmer wants to “keep me all to himself”
*   He trusts her enough to leave her alone with Dr Rank, but after learning that he is going to die, he says “now that you and I have no one but each other”, suggesting that he is **indifferent** to Dr Rank leaving them.
*   He enforces rules and seems to be a person of integrity, and he feels that he is entitled to judge Krogstad
    *   He is a conformist as he **does not question** rules and the society – he is also absent from the debate about moral health and the community in Act 1 between Nora and Dr Rank 
*   He gives Nora no opportunity to explain herself
    *   This is **ironic** because she is able to express her pain and discuss the complexity of the situation with Krogstad, the antagonist of the play, but not her own husband
    *   This links to the differences in **communication**, which ultimately leads to the end of their marriage
*   He takes the rules of the society for granted: he feels that he cannot be questioned since he is a husband and employer: he feels that he has authority as he controls Nora, down to eating the macaroons
    *   He also believes he is an **idealist**, as he **stage-manages** Nora’s dance and lectures Kristine about knitting and embroidering, although he could have been drunk at the time
*   He praises Nora for the tarantella dance, but then continues to take a condescending tone with her
    *   He undermines her by saying, “**Do you think I was going to let her remain there after and spoil the affect?**”
    *   It shows that he only cares about himself and his appearance, and that his wife must always follow and do what he says
    *   He treats her as if she is his possession rather than another human being: this is brought out further by all of the names he calls her such as “capricious little Caprice maiden”, which shows that he does not think of her as an equal
    *   He feels that he has a higher status and more importance in the family, while she is only there for his pleasure
*   He never realizes that he is more interested in power than the rights and wrongs of a situation
*   Although he imagines himself to stand for common sense, although he is quite dramatic himself: “Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake”, and hence conforms to the **stereotypical** image of a male hero
*   However, this “**hero**” disintegrates when he says “**I’m saved**”, as he seems to disregard Nora completely
    *   This follows as he says “I will protect you like a hunted dove that I have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating heart”, which come in direct contrast his **egoistic** attitude of saying “I’m saved!”
*   Although Helmer is the least admirable character, and is clearly **self-centered**, he is not consciously selfish in his own gain at the expense of others
    *   He is **blissfully unaware** of the harsh realities, such as the doctors keeping the illnesses from him


#### Krogstad



*   A lawyer who used to work with Torvald, who is going to get fired by him
*   His character is **contradictory**: although he wants to protect his children, he is willing to use unethical tactics to do so
*   Although he causes sufference to Nora, he feels **sympathy** for her
    *   This, in a way, differentiates him from Helmer
    *   It is also **ironic** that the antagonist is able to feel sympathy, while Helmer himself only cares about himself
*   He is the **antagonist** in the play, although he is **not necessarily the villain**. He tries to justify his behaviour by saying: “Even money-lenders, hacks, well, a man like me, can have a little of what you call feeling, you know.”
    *   Ibsen has not created one-sided binary characters, but rather each character has a spectrum of emotions and empathies, making them more realistic
    *   Hence the play is a modern play
*   Through his willingness to allow Nora's torment to continue is cruel, he still has **sympathy** for her
    *   He also visits her to check on her and discourage her from committing suicide.
*   He has reasonable motives for behaving as he does: he wants to keep his job at the bank in order to spare his children from the hardships that come from a spoiled reputation
    *   This separates him from Torvald: Torvald seems to desire respect from selfish reasons, while Krogstad desires it for his family’s sake
*   His character is also similar to that of Nora’s: both have been wronged by society, and both of them have committed the same crime: forgery of signatures
    *   Through he did break the law, Krogstad’s crime was minor, but the society still saw him as a criminal
    *   He can also be seen as a **victim of circumstances** as he was abandoned by Mrs Linde for a man with more money
    *   Therefore, it can be said that society forced Mrs Linde away from him and prompted his crime


#### Mrs Linde



*   Nora’s childhood friend, she is a practical, down-to-earth women
*   Her account of living in poverty highlights **Nora’s privileged nature**
*   We learn that **she took responsibility** for her sick parents whereas Nora abandoned her father when he was ill
*   Usually male expresses love, but Mrs Linde is a shipwreck, to make it more poignant, she says she is in the wreckage


#### Dr Rank



*   Torvald’s best friend, he is one character who remains **unconcerned** about what others think of him
*   He avoids talking to Torvald about his death out of respect for his distaste for ugliness and things that are not perfect
*   He is the personification of Torald’s thoughts of “diseases” in the “household” that spread to the children
*   He is the play’s detached observer, a common element of well-made plays
*   He is in love with Nora, and has more than a desire for her


#### Nursemaid (Anne-Marie)



*   The Helmer’s nursemaid, who has an **affection** for Nora as she had to give up her own child to take the nursing job
*   She shares with Nora and Mrs Linde the act of sacrificing her own happiness out of economic necessity
*   Nora’s concern at how cold she is suggests that she is more interested in the children's enjoyment than her own comfort
*   It is the nurse who is **responsible** for the fact that Nora feels most comfortable with people who are not authoritative figures such as the servants or Dr Rank
*   It is clear that Nora trusts her enough to bring up the children in her own absence when she leaves Helmer at the end, and this reduces the judgement she receives from the audience as the children are left in good hands
    *   This, in a way, also redeems Nora’s character as we know that the children will be safe
*   She is a character who has suffered the most through poverty and disgrace, and also betrayed by another man, so she had no choice but to give up her own children
    *   Her suffering is in great contrast to the other characters as Krogstad still got to keep his children
    *   Her character can be a role model for Nora, showing that it is possible to make a new life for yourself


### Motifs


#### Nora’s definition of **freedom**



*   Nora's understanding of freedom evolves over the course of the play
*   In Act 1, she believes that she will be totally “free” when she has repaid the debt as she can then devote herself to her domestic responsibilities with ease
*   However, after Krogstad blackmails her, she reconsiders and questions whether she is happy in Torvald’s house, where she is subjected to his orders
*   By the end of the play, she seeks a new kind of freedom; she wants the be relieved of her familial obligations to pursue her own ambitions, beliefs, and identity


#### Letters and **paper**



*   Majority of the plot twists involve the reading and writing of **letters**, which in the play represent the **unpleasant truth**, and situations obscured by Torvald and Nora’s beautification
*   Krogstad writes two letters: one revealing Nora’s crime of forgery and the other retracting his blackmail threat
    *   The **first letter** represents the truth about Nora’s past and initiates the inevitable dissolution of her marriage (she says “We are lost”)
    *   Her attempts to stall Torvald from reading the letter represent her continue denial of the true nature of her marriage: at first even she does not realize that her marriage is an illusion
    *   The **second letter** releases Nora from her obligation to Krogstad and represents her release from her obligation to Torvald
    *   Upon reading it, Torvald attempts to return to his and Nora’s previous **denial of reality**, but Nora recognizes that the letter have exposed the truth about his selfishness, and hence she can no longer participate in the illusion of a happy marriage.
*   Dr Rank’s method of communicating his imminent death is to leave his calling card marked with a black cross in Torvald’s letterbox
*   This is because Torvald has an unwillingness to accept reality when he proclaims, “Torvald is so fastidious, he cannot act up to anything ugly”
*   Mrs Linde also sends a note to Krogstad which initiates her life-changing meeting with him, and Torvald’s letter of dismissal to Krogstad
*   The letter serves as a catalyst in the play, similar to in Wide Sargasso Sea, when Daniel writes a letter 


#### Doors



*   The door slamming is quite a **dramatic** moment for a play
    *   It is quite shocking as it is a result of all the **tension** built up from the beginning of the play
*   Usually dialog was used to show dramatic elements, but now an action and sound is used
*   In the play, the doors usually show changes in mood
*   Krogstad uses the back door when he comes in to be stealthy as he plans something nefarious, while Nora walks out confidentially out of the front door to show her agency
*   Doors could represent the difference in what men and women had the ability to do in the patriarchal society
    *   For example, Nora never left the house, she was almost trapped by Helmer as she does not have access to her own house
    *   Furthermore, she is not permitted to enter Helmer’s study, and she has to use her ears to listen
    *   The state of women is clearly brought out as Nora had to **rebel** in her own house.
*   Doors are also metaphors of the marital relationship, similar to a barrier between Nora and Torvald and how they do not understand each other.
*   Similar to Nora, the nursemaid also left her house because the husband couldn't not fulfill the duties of earning enough money, so she had to leave to earn money


### Symbols


#### The christmas tree



*   Symbolizes **Nora's position in her household** as a **plaything** which is pleasing to look at and adds charm to the house
*   Nora instructs the maid that the children can't see the tree until it has been decorated, and she also tells Torvald that no one can see her in her dress until the evening of the dance
*   At the beginning of the second act, Nora’s psychological condition has begun to erode, and the stage directions also show that the tree is “dishevelled”
*   At the start of Act 2, it is described as “stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its dishevelled branches”: it is starting to contrast the usually contrasting connotations it carries
    *   It currently suggests the continuation of Nora's confusion and belief in the illusion of Helmer accepting and forgiving her actions.
    *   Therefore, the tree is a symbol to Nora’s psychological state


#### New Year's Day	



*   Both Nora and Torvald look forward to New Year’s as a start of a happier live: Torvald will start his new job and certifies extra money and respect the job will give him, and Nora also looks forward to his job as she will be able to repay her debt to Krogstad
*   By the end of the play, however, the nature of the nre start of Newy Year changes dramatically for both of them: they both become new people and face radically changed ways of living
*   Hence the new year comes to mark the beginning of a truly new and different period in both their lives and their personalities


#### Tarantella



*   It was believed that when someone was bitten by one, the only way to get rid of the venom was to dance and sweat it out
*   In the dance scene, Nora is dancing excitedly as she is worried about the consequences of her actions
*   Her dancing can be seen as a way for her to get rid of as much poison as possible so that she does not affect her children
*   It is not a regular dance, as she is very emotional
*   Helmer, the man, is contollering her, and asking her to calm down, having no clue why she is hysterical
    *   Her psychological state is also described as “distracted” from the impending … (find quote)
*   (46 York Notes)


#### Doll



*   At the exposition, Nora notes that dolls are quite cheap and easily breakable [[combined points](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.9x7rpt4yhono)]


#### Lamp (32)



*   In Act 2, the lamp creates a dramatic moment as More symbolically exploits her new light with Dr Rank


### Context



1. Bourgeois
    *   This means belonging to or characteristic of the **middle class**, typically with reference to its perceived materialistic values or conventional attitudes
    *   Bourgeois could also be used to describe conventional people in the 1800s, when economies were growing rapidly leading to people with more wealth, and changing priorities
    *   Krogstad and Torvald are the embodiment of the bourgeoisie while Nora is a victim
    *   The bourgeoisie lifestyle is brought out through Torvald
        *   He symbolizes the average man of that time period, and is described to money-minded, self-righteous, and selfish
    *   He lives under the allusion of him having total control over his family members; this is evident as he treats Nora akin to a “doll”, and casually fires Krogstad for a petty reason
    *   When Nora tells him about the forgery, he abandons his facade of love for her and gets angry, and when Krogstad threat’s disappear, he goes back to his former self, demonstrating his hypocritical nature
    *   Nora was expected to behave hike a typical bourgeoisie women by Torvald, but instead, as the play progresses, she slowly starts to go against the norms of the society, and at the end of the play she openly defies them and separates herself from these values
2. **Metamorphosis**
    *   This is described as a change of the form of a thing or person to something completely different: the process of **transformation from an immature form to an adult**
    *   At the end of the play, Nora metamorphoses as she is self-awakened
        *   She undergoes this change when she realizes that Torvald does not have any real respect for her
3. Women’s emancipation
    *   This was the effort to secure equal rights for women at the remove any gender discrimination from laws and behavioural patterns
    *   In the play, we see an **imbalance in power** through the was Nora is treated by Helmer
    *   She is treated like his “pet” or “property”, and it is evident that Krogstad and Dr. Rank do not take her seriously either as she is a woman
    *   Additionally, she speaks about the sense of “pride” she got from travelling to Italy as it makes her feel “almost like a man”
    *   At the end she realizes that she is not being treated like an equal and hence decides to leave
4. Feminism
    *   It is the belief that both men and women should be provided equal rights and opportunities
    *   _A Doll’s House_ starts with a stereotypical portrayal of women as financially dependent one men, incapable of making decisions or taking care of themselves
    *   The way Helmer treats his wife is demeaning and makes Nora seem like a “doll” to be played with and controlled
    *   However, as the play progresses, we she that she is bright enough to make her own decisions for herself: this ranges from her small lies to the secrecy about both borrowing and forging
        *   She is clever as she is able to manipulate her way around.
        *   We then see her transform into a responsible individual; this is emphasized by the act of her leaving everything she was previously dependent one and looking out for herself
    *   The play being set in 1879 was described as “**a play phenomenally ahead of its time**”
        *   At first, the gender stereotypes were being conformed to around the world and patriarchal societies were the norm
        *   Since then, women have been fighting for equality, and the feminist movement started.
5. Social facades and hypocrisy
    *   A **facade** refers to a false appearance or way of behaving that hides what someone or something really is
        *   This is prevalent in society as people tend to portray themselves in a way different from their true nature in order to fit in with societal norms
    *   **Hypocrisy** is the practise of claiming to have higher standards or more noble beliefs that is the case
    *   Nora was putting up a submissive and helpless **facade** in front of her husband and the rest of the society to fit in with societal expectations from a woman, when in reality she does have the strength and wit (as we see through the way she handles the situation)
    *   This theme is also brought out by Helmer towards the end of the play as he is more concerned about his appearance in society than his wife
6. Idealist
    *   An idealist is someone who believes that very good things can be achieved, often when it seems unlikely to others
    *   _A Doll’s House_ deals with aesthetic idealism
    *   Helmer is the personification of the idealis: noble, high morals, refined taste
        *   Appearances and aesthetics to him are key, as laid out through the opening
    *   His home is carefully decorated: carpeted floors, engravings, and a piano, an expensive item
    *   The ideal he sees in Nora is nothing but a reflection of himself: he is infatuated by her beauty and wants to control her
    *   Nora is the ideal wife catering to his ideal tastes, and behind this fantasy lies a desire for authority in Helmer
7. Patriarchy
    *   It is a social or governmental system in which males hold primary power and dominant roles while women are largely excluded from it. These roles include political leadership, moral authority, social privilege, and control of property
    *   Patriarchal is demonstrated through Helmer as a typical male in the society: he makes all the decisions and controls Nora’s allowance
    *   He treats Nora like a child, and also attempts to control her smallest actions, such as eating macaroons
        *   This reinforces that she has unknowingly taken the role as a “doll”, a toy
    *   Despite Nora's capabilities, she is forbidden from taking charge and making decisions in her own way; she is forced to follow his will, which in turn leaves her suppressed
8. Social class and hierarchy
    *   Class refers to societal division based on economic and social status while hierarchy refers to people being grouped into different social categories (upper, middle, lower)
    *   The play takes place in a Norwegian town in 1979 where there were separated classes in the society, and men were expected to be the head of the family, while women were expected to work at home, without any true power
    *   The play occurred after a time of economic progress, so that middle class was recently made more wealthy
    *   This is made clear with the house which is “comfortably and tastefully furnished”, and the fact that they have servants
    *   Additionally, Nora's behaviour with Krogstad supports this: she feels superior to him as he is a member of the lower class
    *   Furthermore, when Nora and Mrs Linde talk about their husbands, Mrs Linde says that she “didn't think it would be right for [her] to refuse him”. This reiterates the fact that women would get married to improve their status in the society.
    *   There is also a prominent difference between men and women of the same societal class. Nora, a woman, was only expected to have knowledge on domestic affairs
        *   For this reason, she did not tell Torvald that she borrowed money to save his life as it would be “painful and humiliating … with his manly self respect, to know that he owed anything to me.”
    *   This concept is still important today because in many countries there is still a strong divide between the lower, working, and upper class. Women’s rights have increased in recent years.
9. Reception
    *   The play gave rise to debate and controversy, and people fixated one the fact that Nora left her family and responsibilities being because at that time, the greatest responsibility of a woman was not to herself but to her family
    *   For this reason, Ibsen was forced to write an alternate ending for the German theaters as it was unacceptable. Ibsen called the alternative ending “barbaric”, and a “disgrace” to the play. This incident indicated how strong the ideologies of that time were, and how event Ibsen, a man standing against those ideologies, was forced to give in at a certain point.
    *   Presently readers understand Nora’s decisions, but readers are often appalled at the restrictions placed on women in these times


#### Genre: realism



*   Ibsen was a realist playwright as he wrote this play on actual problems in a typical household at the time. He shows an iconoclast in the society
*   The setting also makes it realistic: it is a middle-class bourgeoisie house, and all the action takes place there, hence the audience can easily relate to the issues demonstrated
*   There are also very common props with dramatic effects (such as the Christmas tree showing Nora’s mental state)


## Themes


### Sacrificial role of women



*   There are many instances of sacrificial in the play: Mrs Linde abandoned Krogstad to marry a richer man, the nursemaid abandoned her own children to support herself, and Nora left her children to get a better life for herself
*   Although Nora was economically advantaged compared to the other females, she nevertheless lead a difficult life because socially dictated that Torvald be the marriage’s dominant partner
    *   Torvald condescends Nora, and she had to hide her loan from him because she knows that he could never accept that he is debt to his wife
    *   She also had to work in secret to pay back the loan
    *   In the end, this makes her vulnerable to Krogstad’s blackmail because she has no one to go to for help but herself.
*   The nursemaid’s story serves as a foreshadowing tool as Nora also ends up leaving her husband and children with her
    *   This, in a way, makes the audience judge her less as we know that their children are left under good hands


### Parental and filial obligations



*   Nora, Torvald, and Dr Rank each express the belief that a parent is obligated to be honest and upstanding, because a parent’s immorality is passed on to their children like a disease: “A fog of lies like that in a household, and it spreads disease and infection to every past of it. Every breath the children take in that kind of house is reeking evil germs”
*   In fact, Dr Rank does have a disease which is a direct result of his father's depravity, and he also implies that his father’s immorality (affairs with women) led him to contract a disease that he passed on to his son, leading him to suffer for his father’s misdeeds [find quote]
*   Torvald also strongly believes that one's parents determine one’s moral character with the line: “Nearly all young criminals had lying mothers”, and he also refuses to allow Nora to interact with their children after he learns of her deceit, for fear that she will corrupt them.


### Unreliability of appearances	



*   In the play, appearances are often misleading and mask the reality of the characters and their situations: our first impressions of Nora, Torvald, and Krogstad are eventually undercut. Nora first seems like a childish silly women, but as the play goes on, we see her intelligent, motivated, and by the play’s conclusion, a strong-willed independent thinker
    *   Torvald, though he plays the part of a strong benevolent husband, reveals himself to be **cowardly, petty, and selfish** and he fears Krogstad may expose him to scandal
    *   Krogstad reveals himself to be much more **sympathetic and merciful** than what he first appears to be.
*   The play’s climax is a matter of resolving identity confusion:
    *   Krogstad as a sympathetic and merciful lover
    *   Nora as an intelligent, independent woman who can make her own decisions, and one who has agency
    *   Torvald as someone who only cares about themselves, and one who never cared about his wife
*   Situations are not only misinterpreted by the audience, but also by the characters
    *   The hatred between Mrs Linde and Krogstad turns out to be love
    *   Nora’s creditor turns out to be Krogstad, and not Dr Rank, as we see Mrs Linde suppose
    *   Dr Rank confesses that he is in love with Nora
    *   The seemingly villainous Krogstad repents and returns Nora’s contract to her, while the seemingly kindhearted Mrs Linde ceases to help Nora and forces Torvald’s discovery of Nora’s secret.
*   The appearances within the Helmer Household results from Torvald’s devotion to an image at the expense of the creation of true happiness
    *   Because he craves respect, image is very important to him, and hence he gets angry when disrespected: when Nora calls him petty and when Krogstad address him by his first name
*   By the end of the play, it is clear that while controlling his home’s appearance and his separated suppression and denial of reality have harmed his family and his happiness irreparably


### Love and marriage



*   The entire play is seen as an exploration of love


### Individual and society



*   A doll is a thing whose character is determined by the owner according to the functions it is expected to serve. It does not play any major role and is never removed from the home
    *   In Act 3, Nora says “I believe that before all else I am a reasonable human being”, and is also claiming the right to her**self**.
*   Similar to a doll, in the first two acts, she never leaves the house (she doesn't leave without Helmer), and she is restricted as she cannot enter his study (point expanded on above)
    *   However, in Act 3, she finally leaves the house on her own decision and decides to make a life for herself
*   At the beginning of the play, her identity is determined by others: for Helmer, she is a sexual partner, a mother, and a housekeeper
*   She forges a signature, she assumes that assumes that it will have no effect on who she is. To her, interaction with the outer world is like “being a man”
    *   This shows that at the start of the play, Nora is a stereotypical women who agrees and does not question the societal gender roles
*   After Krostead takes back the blackmail, Helmer feels that he can grant Nora the roles of a mother and wife again without issues, but this is when Nora doesn't agree and decides to leave the home: Nora no longer accepts him as the authority in the relationship (she cannot allow him to redefine motherhood), so she leaves to learn more about herself


### Disease and inheritance



*   When Nora asks for money, Helmer replies: “It is in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora”
    *   However, later we learn that Nora is only pretending to share her father’s extravagance as the money is going to pay off her debt to Krogstad
    *   Her father was likely knowling in fraud and corruption, but her crime is due to her ignorance.
*   Similarly, Dr Rank also has a biological illness that he inherited, and he didn't marry so that the illness could die with him
*   Both Helmer and Dr Rank use the **metaphor** of corrupt behaviour as moral sickness
    *   For Helmer, this sickness invariably spreads, and its source is at home, and can also infect the children with the “germs of evil”.
*   The play is full of graphic images of death: Rank describes his own body: “rotting in the churchyard”, and Nora seems to intend to die in the “icy, black water”
    *   However, Krogstad and Nora understand that suicide is not a noble sacrifice


### Money



*   Nora borrows money to do something useful, but the money is not represented in actual money, but rather as a piece of paper (link to the motif of paper), which is an evidence of the crime she committed 
*   Her criminal act has brought her into a new world which is **male-dominated**: she proclaims her place in a world of “quarterly interest” and “installments”
*   Helmer is quick to condemn Nora; although his job at the bank involves borrowing and lending money, he does not want a debt
    *   This brings out the irony and the hypocrisy


### Home



*   Nora’s once home in Act 1 becomes a prison in which she feels she has been trapped and restricted [find quote] in Act 3, so she decided to leave
*   Nora is called skylark, squirrel, songbird, all of which are wild creatures
    *   This can be linked to the fact that the house is a cage for Nora, and it is also shown as she is not even given access to her own house (see above)


## Language and style



*   Helmer always refers to Nora by a nickname or patronizing adjective such as “little”, followed by “lark”, “songbird”, “squirrel”, and he often uses the possessive pronoun “my”
*   Nora has many soliloquies throughout the play
    *   For example, at the end of Act 2, Nora says to herself: “Five o'clock. Seven hours until midnight; and then four-and-twenty hours until the next midnight. Then the Tarantella will be over. Twenty-four and seven? Thirty-one hours to live.”
    *   The bird names also depict the weakness of Nora
        *   Torvald saw this as a way to control her, by making her weaker than she already is


## Structure



*   The play follows the structure of a **well-made play**: the exposition sets up the situation through the conversations, and the audience are informed with everything they know to understand what has already happened
*   We are also aware that the situation is pressing as Nora is in crisis, and Act 1 ends on a note of high suspense and drama with Krogstad's demand
*   In Act 2, we see Nora struggle to find a way out of the situation: first she tries to change Helmer’s mind, then she tries to act Dr. Rank for help, then when all the solutions change, Krogstad changes the demands by making them more serious
*   Nora’s dissertation, using her tarantella to postpone the inevitable creates a high dramatic impact
*   In Act 3, the suspense is developed further by Ibsen creating possible resolution of the letter being destroyed. More suspense is also created as Dr Rank delays Helmer’s reading of the letter
*   The play ends with the dramatic confrontation of Nora and Helmer. Nora’s leaving at that time allows the play to end dramatically
    *   Had she taken time to decide, all the dramatic impact would have been lost
    *   Furthermore, she also left at that moment to ensure that the play has unity of time
*   The play ends in Christmas with “greatest miracle of all”, which is a possible redemption for Torvald as he seems to have understood the role of Nora in his live as a lover

### Act 2



1. When a poor girl’s been in trouble she must take the best of things: the nursemaid
2. Nora (31): “Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learnt at Capri.
    *   She is dressing up exactly how Helmer wants her
3. Kristine (31): “I see; you are going to keep up the character”	
    *   This brings in some irony, as she says that she will “keep up the character”, as if she knows that the marriage is just an illusion
4. Kristine (31): “But, my deases Nora, how do you know anything about such things”
    *   Similar to Helmer, Kristine also treats Nora like a child and does not think she is intelligent
5. Nora: “Torvald is so absurfly fond of me that he wants me absolutely to himself”
    *   She mistakes his attitudes as love and romance
    *   She is lost in her utopian illusions
6. Nora: “Torvald can't bear to see dressmaking going on”
    *   Only wants to see perfection: the house is meant to be kept as he pleases
    *   The dressmaking is messy work, which Torvald can’t bear to see, similar to why Dr. Rank doesn't want Helmer to see his dead body
7. Nora (34): “If your little squirrel were to ask you for something very, very prettily–”
    *   Shows that men have dominance in the household, and they make all the important decisions
    *   Women were dependent on men for everything, including getting money/allowance: they are financially dependent on men
    *   Therefore, Nora must seduce and manipulate her husband in order to get him to do something she needs or wants
8. Helmer (35): “Is it to get about now that the new manager has changed his mind at his wife’s bidding”
    *   He thinks he will be judged if his wife, a woman, were able to change his mind
    *   His appearance is very important to him and he wants to show that he is independent
9. Helmer (35): “if only this obstinate little person can get her way!”
    *   He doesn't treat Nora as an equal individual, rather he treats her like a child
    *   His views are clearly more important to him
10. Rank (38): “You are a greater rascal than I thought”
    *   Not only does Torvald treating Nora like a child, but even Dr Rank does
    *   This shows that men had a higher position on the society
    *   Women were supposed to be submissive towards the men
11. Rank (40): “Nora––do you think he is the only one––?”
    *   Dr Rank expressed his love for Nora
    *   This is what causes Nora not to ask him for the money
12. Krogstad (43): “It would not be the least like our dear Torvald Helmer to show so much courage”	
    *   He mocks Torvald offstage
13. Krogstad (44): “Or even something worse–– …… Give up the idea”
    *   Krogstad knows that Nora will likely commit suicide, so he tries to persuade her not to
    *   He has been the same situation before, so he knows how she will think
    *   Although he is the villain, he cares about Nora, more than Torvald himself does
14. Krogstad (44): “For the last year and a half I have not had a hand in anything dishonorable”
    *   We, as audience, learn that Krogstad is an honest man, and also a victim of circumstances
    *   Helmer’s reasons for wanting to fire him are mostly personal as he is not respected by him; Helmer is likely being quite unreasonable
15. Krogstad (45): “Oh, you can’t frighten me. A fine, spoilt lady like you––”


### Act 3



1. Krogstad: “I am a shipwrecked man clinging to a bit of wreckage”
    *   Contrasts the relation between Helmer and Nora
    *   There is mutual respect and reciprocation in the relation of Krogstad and Christine
2. Christine: “Nils, give me someone and something to work for”
    *   In this relation, Christine proposes to Krogstad, and is hence classified as an iconoclast
    *   This differentiates their relationship, there is mutual respect and reciprocation
3. Helmer: “Why shouldn't I look at my dearest treasure?--at all the beauty that is mine, all my very own?”
    *   Possessive and controlling, objectifies by calling her his treasure
    *   He talks to her as if he owns her


## Notes


### Unities



*   Time: it makes it dramatic that she leaves the house right at that time
    *   If she waited to think, the dramatic impact that was built up in their conversation would be lost
    *   The play ends with a high dramatic impact.
*   Place: the play takes place in a single place
*   Action: there is mainly one plot
    *   Although there is a subplot, it reinforces the main plot (The misunderstandings and dysfunctional marriage of Nora and Helmer)


#### SImilarities in the crimes of Krogstad and Nora



*   Krogstad was disrupted as he forged a signature for greed and personal/family advancement
    *   He underwent unethical means to advance his family and himself
*   Nora also forged a signature to save mostly her family
*   In the end, both paid a price
*   Both have been marginalized by society or their family
    *   Krogstad was marginalized professionally and socially
    *   Nora on accounts of her gender
*   Both are “poisoning” their children with crime
    *   Torvald blames Nora for her bad “genes”
*   The idea of **inherited madness** is also seen in Wide Sargasso Sea, and is used against characters


### Dr Rank’s interactions with Nora (30 york notes)



*   Early on in the play, we learn that Dr Rank and Nora are good friends, and he is considered an equal to Helmer
*   Helmer also trusts Dr Rank to be left alone with Nora
*   In Act 2, when Nora tries to borrow the money from Dr Rank, we see Nora have an adult conversation with someone for the first time
    *   Helmer and Kristine both treated her like a child, like someone who is protected from the harsh realities of life, although we as audience know that she is not 
    *   Her interaction with Dr Rank goes against her constant infantilizing
*   Dr Rank and Nora’s interaction create a **subtext**, which is when unspoken ideas and emotions are shown
    *   Both Nora and Dr Rank speak in code, making it clear that Nora understands his situation
    *   Dr Rank develops on Helmer’s point about hereditary, and his comparison to Nora’s father


### Nora’s departure and ending



*   The protagonist took a crucial decision to leave her family after understanding that she had lived in illusion for the past years: she wanted to face reality.
*   She was blinded from the truth by comfort; she was trapped in domestic comfort and gets everything she wants, while losing touch with the outside world and consequently realizing the truth
*   She first realizes that she is not truly loved when she is prevented from eating what she loved
*   She was expecting a miracle in which her husband would save her from the danger, but instead when she witnessed the complete opposite, and hence she revolted and left him
    *   She has always obeyed his wished and expected him to save her
    *   It came as a shock to her that he only cared about himself..
*   She also found out that she had no identity, as it was completely shaped by her father and husband. She was deprived of speech and action, and hence decided to leave Torvald. When the forgery was revealed, she was made aware that her relationship with her husband was not mutual. She also found an imbalance in power distribution between her husband and her as Torvald was the dominant one. She made nothing out of her life as she had been living under the shadow of other men (Torvald and her father: she says she has “been greatly wronged, Torvald––first by papa and then by you”). She decides to leave the Helmer household and experience the world for herself
*   Essentially, she wants to discover who she really is, she wants to educate herself
    *   She is willing to break her marriage in doing so, demonstrating that she has agency.
*   Nora’s independent nature is in direct contrast with the tyrannical authority of Torvald
    *   They both are not truthful to each other
    *   When Torvald is proved to be disloyal and ungrateful, she leaves in order to find a better life for herself
*   Through the course of the play, Nora grows, and reveals all the flaws in her relationship with Torvald; she exposes him
*   Her development and transformation as a women leads to her emancipation
*   **However**, she is going back to her father’s place to inherit all of his wealth, so she really isn't doing anything other than leaving him
    *   She is still going to be protected with her father’s house and saving, so it is questionable whether she is going to make a life for herself


### Self-awakening



*   Nora's illusions about her family life are shattered by Helmer’s selfish and insensitive reaction to the news of Nora’s forgery: “What a horrible awakening! All these eight years--she who was my joy and pride--a hypocrite, a liar--worse, worse--a criminal!”
    *   Helmer’s outburst grows her self-awakening, and Nora is finally able to see the truth in Helmer's character


### Communication



*   The play begins with superficial communications and dialogs: Torvald calls Nora his “little lark” and a “featherhead”
    *   Nora exhibits a sense of false childishness in her actions such as “turning around quickly” and getting excited at the mention of money; she is also “playing with his coat buttons”
    *   Torvald also seems to be close to Nora (false sense of closeness) with actions such as “taking her playfully by the ear” and “wagging his finger at her”
*   These are all non-verbal communications, but they do not give a correct idea of their relationship
*   Later, we see Nora speaking to other characters such as Kristine and Krogstad more seriously
    *   She divulges her secrets to Mrs Linde
    *   She appears more **familiar** and **relaxed** with Dr Rank
    *   She says “Well, I’m damned” in front of them, something she would never say in front of Torvald
    *   This reinforces the difference in her relationship with Torvald and Dr Rank/Kristine
*   Her conversation with Krogstad is also quite different
    *   She is calm, composed, and quite serious, showing her ability to achieve a **serious conversation**
    *   She also shows **confidence** as she says that “one has a tiny little bit of influence”
    *   She does not speak seriously in front to Torvald, apart from the end of the play
*   The lack of communication led to the ending of the relationship
    *   Torvald was unable to understand Nora due to their poor communication
