Explain two factors other than GDP per capita that can cause a change in total fertility rate [2+2]\n    *   pro- and anti-natalist policies\n    *   war\n    *   migration\n    *   women empowerment\n    *   disease\n    *   falling infant mortality\n    *   Education: increased female mortality, so women have less children\n        *   they know that most of the children will survive\n        *   they understand birth control and its advantages; it’s more easily accessible\n        *   they are more career-minded, so they want to start a career before a family\n    *   shift away from subsistence farming\n    *   Location of residence\n    *   Religion\n    *   Ambition and need for children\n2. Identify and explain the positive effects of migration [6]\n    *   Increase in economically active population (reduce dependency ratio)\n    *   Perform unskilled and low-paid work\n    *   Fill gaps in the skilled jobs market (nurses, doctors from abroad)\n    *   Increase tax revenues and boost local economies through spending\n    *   Increase the birth rates for countries with an aging population\n    *   Reduce unemployment levels in the country of origin\n    *   Remittances sent home by countries\n    *   Increase the variety of cultures in hosting country\n3. Explain factors that affect the potential mobility of voluntary migrants [3]\n    *   Age\n    *   Gender\n    *   Education levels\n    *   National and international policies on, and obstacles to, migration\n    *   Economic factors\n    *   Social and cultural factors\n    *   Accessibility/transport infrastructures\n4. Suggest reasons for the gender imbalance [6]\n    *   males outnumber females starting from ages (x–y) because\n    *   more male babies born, or female infanticide because males are favored\n    *   lack of females from 20–65 (working age) due to high rates of maternal mortality\n        *   worsened by poor nutrition\n        *   diseases (HIV/AIDS) cause high mortality rates among females more than in mass\n        *   High rates of maternal mortality\n    *   in age groups above, more females survive as they (generally) have higher life expectancy than males\n        *   males could have been lost through migration though war\n        *   Males are more likely to have jobs which decrease the lifespan, such as construction\n5. Explain three economic impacts of a disease you studied [6]\n    *   disease: HIV/AIDS in Botswana, Namibia in Southern Africa, which is the worst affected region\n        *   Sub-Saharan Africa has 11% of the world’s people, but carries 24% of the global disease burden\n        *   Less than 1% of global health expenditure\n        *   Religious practices are against safe-sex campaigns in Sub-Saharan Africa, and people follow them due to lower levels of education\n    *   loss of people in the working age: increasing dependency ratio and reducing economic output, and this reduces the overall GDP of the country\n    *   reduced productivity of farmers and industry workers, leading to a reduction in economic output and reduce in GDP\n    *   increased burden on individuals and family finances owing to the cost of medical care, pharmaceutical care, and funerals\n    *   early entry of children into the workforce (who were orphaned by disease)\n6. Explain why men generally have a lower life expectancy than women [2+2]\n    *   Men tend to engage in more risky occupations (mining, construction) thereby increasing their mortality rate\n    *   High-risk behaviors/lifestyle choices (smoking, drinking, diet)\n    *   Biological makeup of men different compared to women\n    *   Crime related factors\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n1. This question is about birth control\n    1. Suggest two reasons why the percentage of women using some types of birth control is low in some countries [2+2]\n        *   Religious/cultural reasons\n        *   Poverty: cannot afford birth control\n        *   Access: many women live in remote regions and do not have access to contraceptives\n        *   Lack of gender empowerment: could be low priority that contraceptives not there\n    2. Explain two reasons why the crude death rate is falling in most LICs [2+2]\n        *   Vaccination programmes\n        *   Water and sanitation\n        *   Increased **wealth** in some nations: more hospitals, better health care\n        *   Improving **food security** measures\n        *   Education, especially of women makes healthier families\n        *   **Diet**, improving due to better access and distribution\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n1. Examine the problems that result from high dependency ratios [E]\n    *   Dependency ratio: the ratio of the dependent population (those aged below 15 and above 64) to the economically active population (population aged 15–64)\n    *   High demand on health services and healthcare costs due to large elderly population\n    *   public/private pension schemes not being able to support the elderly population\n    *   Strain on educational facilities in countries with a high birth rate\n    *   Small working population left not being able to support the dependent population\n    *   Limited tax revenues generated, only allowing limited investment in infrastructure and services\n\n\n# Global climate: vulnerability and resilience\n\n\n\n1. Describe the change in albedo as ice melts and is replaced by soil/bare rock [2]\n    *   the ice melts and is replaced by rock so there is a change in the color and hence the albedo created as ice reflects more heat\n    *   the dark surface of the rock absorbs more insulation, leading to a rise in temperature\n    *   there is also a **positive feedback** loop: melting ice reduces albedo, so less reflection, and more energy is absorbed and hence an increase in temperature\n2. Differentiate between the greenhouse effect and global warming [2]\n    *   the **greenhouse effect is a natural effect** in which certain gases (water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and CFCs) allow SWR from the sun to pass through the atmosphere and heat up the path, but trap an increasing proportion of LWR from the earth\n    *   this radiation leads to the warming of the atmosphere, and is essential for our survival\n    *   in contrast, **global warming is an increase in temperature around the world**, that started in the 1960s, and has been going on most likely because of human activity\n3. Distinguish between global climate change and enhanced greenhouse effect [4]\n    *   Global climate (GCC) change is the _change in global patterns of climate_ (precipitation, temperature, wind, pressure systems)\n    *   Enhanced greenhouse (EGE) effect is the _increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of human activities_\n    *   GCC can have natural causes whereas the EGG is anthropogenic\n    *   GCC can relate to any aspect of climate whereas the EGE specifically impacts upon temperature\n    *   GCC can involve cooling periods whereas EGE is associated with global warming\n    *   EGE is a major cause of GCC\n4. Explain how deforestation may contribute to global warming [3]\n    *   deforestation releases carbon dioxide are removes a valuable carbon sink\n    *   this increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\n    *   carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas linked to global warming as it helps raise the quantity of heat retained by the atmosphere\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n1. This question is about soil degradation\n    1. State likely causes of soil degradation\n        *   overgrazing, agriculture, overexploitation of vegetation for fuelwood deforestation, salinization, urban growth, industrialization\n    2. Explain socio-economic consequences of soil degradation\n        *   loss of agriculture productivity of land acts as push factors to migration\n        *   loss of agriculture productivity, food shortages, famine, push factor, farmers too weak to work, other farmers discouraged from farming, less farmers so even less food\n        *   reduced aquifer recharge damages farmers’ incomes and water access\n        *   loss of employment, increased poverty in an area\n        *   creates environmental refugees, problems of displaced populations\n2. This question is about the climate change of an increase in 2ºC in sub-Saharan Africa\n3. Outline the likely changes in crop production in sub-Saharan Africa, if there is a temperature increase of 2ºC [2]\n    *   40–80% of maize, millet, and sorghum crops lost\n    *   reduction in crop production of wheat, maize, and sorghum (change in agriculture patterns)\n4. Suggest reasons for the changes outlined in (a) [2]\n    *   increased temperature causes an increase in evaporation, which causes a reduction in moisture levels, and hence an increase in erosivity (so less plants grown)\n    *   because of droughts due to high evaporation and less moisture, the soil loses important nutrients for plant growth and hence reduces the fertile content of the soil\n    *   the decrease in crop productivity discourages farmers from farming, so in the future there will be less farmers, and hence an even lower crop productivity\n    *   because of human population growth, more farmland must be used for buildings and other infrastructural development; agricultural land is used up\n    *   there can also be extreme heat waves in the summer making soil drier than normal with less water and nutrients\n5. Explain why there could be a decrease in biodiversity\n    *   there are less plants due to the increase in moistures and decrease in nutrients from the soil, so herbivores are affected; there could be a loss in grazing land\n    *   because herbivores are lower in number because of less food, food webs are affected and even carnivores are reduced in population\n    *   an increase in temperature causes an increase in drought conditions\n    *   decertification and desert migration takes place––desert migration reduces the fertile content of the soil (there is an increase in silica, making the soil less fertile)\n    *   this desertification causes a loss of Savanna, which is a more suitable habitat for many plants and animals than the desert\n6. Explain one social problem that court result from climate change in sub-Saharan Africa [2]\n    *   climate changes in sub-Saharan Africa may cause many farmers to stop farming and migrate to urban areas\n    *   farmers will produce less food and receive less money and become impoverished; they might look for alternative employment in urban areas\n    *   climate change may lead to malnutrition, especially in farmers who get too weak to work\n    *   malnourished mothers will give birth to underweight children, and they could have mental problems, so their life chances are badly affected\n\n\n# Global resource consumption and security\n\n\n\n1. Explain how demand for energy resources is changing [3]\n    *   Geographical pattern of demand is projected to shift from the OECD region to NICs\n    *   Demand for and use of energy resources by NICs has been rapidly increasing, although HICs are major consumers\n    *   Energy resources are used in large quantities for manufacturing and transporting in MICs and NICs\n    *   LICs and MICs continue to grow faster than HICs but their consumption remains low by comparison\n2. Explain why the ecological footprint of HICs is greater than that of LICs [6]\n    *   Smaller rates of resource consumption in LICs\n    *   In HICs people have more **disposable income**, so they have a higher consumption and demand for energy resources\n    *   HIC resource use is often **more wasteful** and they produce more pollution\n    *   People in LICs have less to spend on consumption, and the **informal economy **is responsible for **recycling** many resources\n    *   HICs have a meat-eating diet; 30% of the diet may be based on animal protein, and this way only a small amount of energy is transported to the people\n    *   Greenhouse gas emissions affect the footprint; HICs import and export more which leads to more transport which releases greenhouse gases\n3. Explain food security [2]\n    *   The availability and access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food\n    *   To meet the dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\n4. Explain the limitations of recycling as a strategy to reduce global resource consumption [3]\n    *   Energy still consumed in transportation (import and export) of waste to recycling centers\n    *   Energy used for recycling process\n    *   Some materials can’t be recycled or are too expensive\n    *   Recycling not available at a large enough scale to deal with all the waste\n    *   There may be better alternatives: substitution, lower consumption\n    *   Desire for economic growth greater than desire for sustainability\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n1. This question is about malthus and other theories\n    1. Explain the neo-Malthusian view of the relationship between population size and resource consumption. [4]\n        *   Neo = contemporary supporters of views of Malthus\n        *   Human population has a carrying capacity\n        *   Because it increases geometrically while resources increase arithmetically\n        *   Leading to check (positive or preventive), or a need for anti-natalist policies\n    2. Explain the anti-Malthusian view of the relationship between population and resources [6]\n        *   Resources will keep pace with population growth, and carrying capacity will increase as human population increases\n        *   The use of technological fixes (in agriculture to achieve higher yields, GMO)\n        *   Resource substitution overcome resource depletion\n        *   Recycling allows conservation of existing resources\n2. This question is about food and hunger\n    3. Briefly describe the difference between malnutrition and undernutrition [3]\n        *   Undernutrition is defined as the shortage of food/insufficient calorie intake and/or protein intake (refers to quantity)\n        *   Malnutrition is an imbalance of food such as vitamins, fats, carbohydrates (refers to quality of food, or deficiency)\n        *   Malnutrition takes place in MEDCs (obesity) and undernutrition takes place in LEDCs (protein deficiency)\n    4. Using examples, explain why food aid does not always alleviate hunger [8]\n        *   Food aid helps as emergency short term response for the immediate alleviation of hunger, decreasing mortality and controlling disease\n        *   It has detrimental effects: lowering food production in receiving country, increased dependency, increasing levels of corruption (food not distributed equally)\n3. This question is about the sustainable development goals\n    5. Explain why they might be difficult to achieve\n        *   They are so ambitious in their aims\n        *   Population continues to grow, and standards of living are rising\n        *   The concept of sustainability is an intergenerational one and will never be found/end\n        *   Many political and terrorist organizations for which sustainable development is not their main focus\n    6. Outline the main inequalities in gender identified by them\n        *   G10: reduce inequalities in gender; G8: eradicate human trafficking and forced labor, which targets many womens\n        *   G3: good health and well being focuses in improving reproductive and maternal health\n        *   G4 and G5: quality education aims to improve education and training for women too\n\n\n# Leisure, tourism, and sport\n\n\n\n1. Describe the characteristics of the leisure hierarchy [2+2]\n    *   Many sports fields for junior/student teams for a particular sport in a city than there are sports fields for professional teams in the same city\n    *   While student team fields will have only a relatively small catchment area, the catchment area of the professional fields will be much larger\n2. Explain **geographical factors** that might influence decision-makers in choosing a host city for an international sports events [2+2+2]\n    *   Pre-existing venues for reducing construction costs (ex: Rio de Janeiro hosting the 2016 Olympics using venues developed for the World Cup)\n    *   Good international transport links such as airports for increasing accessibility\n    *   Good local transport infrastructure to increase accessibility\n    *   Available accommodation, for participants and supporters\n    *   corruption/money/politics\n3. Give evidence that the perceptual carrying capacity has been exceeded (image description) [3]\n    *   Crowded car park\n    *   Congestion in narrow streets\n    *   Noise pollution from vehicles and people\n4. Explain three reasons for the **changes** in **international tourist arrivals** [2+2+2]\n    *   Cost of air travel has reduced in recent years, so that more tourists can travel cheaply (Europe to Asia has been made much cheaper)\n    *   Increases tourism advertising in Africa has been heavily promoted in the media, so that tourists are increasingly attracted to new/more exotic destinations (The Gambia from China)\n    *   Increased affluence and leisure time for travel; changing employment patterns as people demand more paid holidays and tourism lets them stay motivated and productive\n    *   Growth of package holidays/TNCs such as Thomas Cook Group\n    *   Development of tourist infrastructure at destinations (Hamad airport in Qatar)\n    *   Credit cards/Visa Cash makes travel and payments easier\n    *   Online booking and the Internet make booking easier\n5. Explain three **political factors** that affect **participation** and success in international sport\n    *   Government spending on specific/internationally-oriented sport facilities such as swimming pools and stadiums, thereby increasing chance of success in Olympic Games\n    *   The government’s role hosting of an international sporting events, such as the Olympics, which promotes national pride and encourages people to participate more widely in the sport\n    *   The government’s role promoting sport in education (national curricula to promote sport in schools and colleges enables elite athletes to reach global potential\n    *   Political initiatives to promote sport/government advertising with emphasis on “world-beating” potential\n    *   Government support in the hosting of an international sporting events\n    *   Specific political values may encourage or deter participation (Islamic states’ attitudes to female participation)\n6. Using photographic evidence, suggest why the perceptual carrying capacity of this site might have been reached. [2]\n    *   Large number of visitors shown\n    *   Some may be experiencing stress due to congestion and noise\n7. Explain two possible reasons why not all international arrivals can be classified as tourists [2]\n    *   transit/short-term passengers, not staying at least one night\n    *   refugees/asylum seekers\n    *   Business people\n    *   Long-term voluntary migrants\n    *   Research scientists\n    *   Returning residents\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n1. This question is about ecotourism\n    1. Outline what is meant by ecotourism\n        *   Responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment\n        *   Sustains the well-being of local people\n        *   Involves interpretation and education\n    2. Outline what is meant by heritage tourism\n        *   Tourism based on **historic legacy as its major attraction**\n        *   Relates to travel to experience the place, artefacts, historic sites, and indigenous people of an area\n    3. Explain one strength and one weakness of ecotourism for local communities [2+2]\n        *   Strength: responsible ecotourism provides jobs for local people (guides in Kenya)\n        *   Weakness: limited potential for growth, because likely commercialization of traditional culture\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n1. Using one or more examples, evaluate the strategies designed to manage tourism in rural areas [E]\n    *   Designation of areas as National Parks or protected zones\n    *   Restrictions on the use of cars in sensitive areas (Orchard Road on weekends)\n    *   Encouragement of cycling by provision of bike hire and cycleways\n    *   Improvement of local public transport\n    *   Improved education and signage; education and information centers\n    *   Increased focus on ecotourism\n    *   Limiting tourist numbers\n    *   Redistributing tourists from honeypot sites\n2. Evaluate the use of tourism as a development strategy in some low-income countries [E]\n    *   Tourism is a rapid growth industry and many-low income countries see its promotion as a development strategy\n    *   The benefits include\n        *   Creation of jobs in the tertiary sector (hotels, tourist guides) and stimulates multiplier effect\n        *   Generating income for the country through tourist expenditure and taxes\n        *   Improvements in infrastructure\n        *   Developing new skills and technology\n    *   The disadvantages include\n        *   Creating dependency on one industry which might be a problem if tourists stop visiting because of natural disaster or political unrest\n        *   Unequal development and growth of tourist enclaves\n        *   Economic leakages as profits go overseas (by international tourism agencies)\n        *   Worker exploitation: much employment is unskilled and low-paid while better-paid, more-skilled jobs go to foreign workers\n        *   Increase rural-urban migration and development of shanty towns and the informal sector\n3. Examine the extent to which sustainable tourism might be successfully implemented in different environments [E]\n    *   Protection of the natural environment through tourism (formation of National Parks)\n    *   Managing resources to prevent depletion\n    *   Reducing the ecological footprint of tourism\n    *   Managing visitor numbers\n    *   Involvement of local people in the tourist activities\n    *   Development of infrastructure\n\n\n# Food and health\n\n\n\n1. Briefly outline “food security” [2]\n    *   Access to food\n    *   Sufficient amount\n    *   Safety\n    *   Nutritional quality\n2. Outline ways in which the health of a pollution can be affected by chronic hunger [2]\n    *   Long-term under-nutrition resulting in stunting/body weight loss\n    *   Increased vulnerability to diseases due to weaker immune system\n    *   High maternal/infant mortality rate due to lack of nutritious food\n3. Explain three geographic impacts at a national scale of one named water-borne or sexually transmitted disease [6]\n    *   HIV in Switzerland currently affects around 20,000 people currently, with 542 new cases in 2016\n    *   HIV has impacted Switzerland’s GDP due to lost working hours and lower productivity, leading to many impacts\n    *   High death rates/infant mortality rates\n    *   Cost of health care\n    *   Decrease in tourism\n    *   Cost of prevention policies\n4. Explain health improvements that have led to an increase in life expectancy in many LICs in recent years [6]\n    *   Improved access to save water resulting in a reduction of waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea\n    *   Vector-borne diseases (malaria) reduced by strategies such as bed nets, spraying, cleaning stagnant water\n    *   Reduction in STDs, such as HIV/AIDS, due to better education and use of condoms\n    *   Rollout of antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) has increased life expectancy of people with HIV\n    *   Improvements in medical care, number of doctors/health professionals; vaccinations\n    *   Improvement In food supply, reduced incidence of death from malnutrition\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n1. Examine the strengths and limitations of the energy efficiency ratio as an indicator of sustainable agriculture. [E]\n    *   Energy efficiency ratio is a measure of the amount of energy input into a farming system compared with the energy outputs. A ration of greater than 1 is considered efficient, as outputs will be greater than inputs\n    *   Inputs into the system include labor, machinery, fertilizers, irrigation, and fuel, while outputs refer to the quantity/yield of food that is produced\n    *   Energy efficiency ratios differ for many farmer systems around the world, capital-intensive systems, such as irrigated rice farming, are likely to have high inputs and high yields, and might be considered as efficient\n    *   Subsistence farming systems with high inputs of labor, might also be regarded as efficient if the outputs are high\n    *   Energy efficiency ratios differ for many farming systems around the world. Capital-intensive systems, such as irrigated rice farming, are likely to have high inputs and high yields, and might be considered as efficient. Subsistence farming systems, with high inputs of labour, might also be regarded as efficient if the outputs are high.\n    *   Farming systems differ in their EERs and their relative sustainability. EER might be a good indicator of the efficiency of a farming system, but it neglects the wider environmental and social impacts of farming. Agricultural systems that have a high EER might produce plentiful food supplies, but they are not necessarily sustainable. The farming system might have an adverse impact on the land or water – for example, irrigation might lead to salinization and depletion of groundwater; pesticides might result in eutrophication, and soil quality might be degraded.\n\n\n# Other skills\n\n\n\n1.

melts and is replaced by rock so there is a change in the color and hence the albedo created as ice reflects more heat</li>\n<li>the dark surface of the rock absorbs more insulation, leading to a rise in temperature</li>\n<li>there is also a <strong>positive feedback</strong> loop: melting ice reduces albedo, so less reflection, and more energy is absorbed and hence an increase in temperature</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Differentiate between the greenhouse effect and global warming [2]\n<ul>\n<li>the <strong>greenhouse effect is a natural effect</strong> in which certain gases (water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and CFCs) allow SWR from the sun to pass through the atmosphere and heat up the path, but trap an increasing proportion of LWR from the earth</li>\n<li>this radiation leads to the warming of the atmosphere, and is essential for our survival</li>\n<li>in contrast, <strong>global warming is an increase in temperature around the world</strong>, that started in the 1960s, and has been going on most likely because of human activity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Distinguish between global climate change and enhanced greenhouse effect [4]\n<ul>\n<li>Global climate (GCC) change is the <em>change in global patterns of climate</em> (precipitation, temperature, wind, pressure systems)</li>\n<li>Enhanced greenhouse (EGE) effect is the <em>increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of human activities</em></li>\n<li>GCC can have natural causes whereas the EGG is anthropogenic</li>\n<li>GCC can relate to any aspect of climate whereas the EGE specifically impacts upon temperature</li>\n<li>GCC can involve cooling periods whereas EGE is associated with global warming</li>\n<li>EGE is a major cause of GCC</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Explain how deforestation may contribute to global warming [3]\n<ul>\n<li>deforestation releases carbon dioxide are removes a valuable carbon sink</li>\n<li>this increases

production of wheat, maize, and sorghum (change in agriculture patterns)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Suggest reasons for the changes outlined in (a) [2]\n<ul>\n<li>increased temperature causes an increase in evaporation, which causes a reduction in moisture levels, and hence an increase in erosivity (so less plants grown)</li>\n<li>because of droughts due to high evaporation and less moisture, the soil loses important nutrients for plant growth and hence reduces the fertile content of the soil</li>\n<li>the decrease in crop productivity discourages farmers from farming, so in the future there will be less farmers, and hence an even lower crop productivity</li>\n<li>because of human population growth, more farmland must be used for buildings and other infrastructural development; agricultural land is used up</li>\n<li>there can also be extreme heat waves in the summer making soil drier than normal with less water and nutrients</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Explain why there could be a decrease in biodiversity\n<ul>\n<li>there are less plants due to the increase in moistures and decrease in nutrients from the soil, so herbivores are affected; there could be a loss in grazing land</li>\n<li>because herbivores are lower in number because of less food, food webs are affected and even carnivores are reduced in population</li>\n<li>an increase in temperature causes an increase in drought conditions</li>\n<li>decertification and desert migration takes place––desert migration reduces the fertile content of the soil (there is an increase in silica, making the soil less fertile)</li>\n<li>this desertification causes a loss of Savanna, which is a more suitable habitat for many plants and animals than the desert</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Explain one social problem that court result from climate change in sub-Saharan Africa [2]\n<ul>\n<li>climate changes in sub-Saharan Africa may cause many farmers to stop farming and migrate to urban areas</li>\n<li>farmers will produce less food and receive less money and become impoverished; they might look for alternative employment in urban areas</li>\n<li>climate change may lead to malnutrition, especially in farmers who get too weak to work</li>\n<li>malnourished mothers will give birth to underweight children, and they could have mental problems, so their life chances are badly

comparison</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Explain why the ecological footprint of HICs is greater than that of LICs [6]\n<ul>\n<li>Smaller rates of resource consumption in LICs</li>\n<li>In HICs people have more <strong>disposable income</strong>, so they have a higher consumption and demand for energy resources</li>\n<li>HIC resource use is often <strong>more wasteful</strong> and they produce more pollution</li>\n<li>People in LICs have less to spend on consumption, and the **informal economy **is responsible for <strong>recycling</strong> many resources</li>\n<li>HICs have a meat-eating diet; 30% of the diet may be based on animal protein, and this way only a small amount of energy is transported to the people</li>\n<li>Greenhouse gas emissions affect the footprint; HICs import and export more which leads to more transport which releases greenhouse gases</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Explain food security [2]\n<ul>\n<li>The availability and access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious

Examine the problems that result from high dependency ratios [E]\n    *   Dependency ratio: the ratio of the dependent population (those aged below 15 and above 64) to the economically active population (population aged 15–64)\n    *   High demand on health services and healthcare costs due to large elderly population\n    *   public/private pension schemes not being able to support the elderly population\n    *   Strain on educational facilities in countries with a high birth rate\n    *   Small working population left not being able to support the dependent population\n    *   Limited tax revenues generated, only allowing limited investment in infrastructure and services\n\n\n# Global climate: vulnerability and resilience\n\n\n\n1. Describe the change in albedo as ice melts and is replaced by soil/bare rock [2]\n    *   the ice melts and is replaced by rock so there is a change in the color and hence the albedo created as ice reflects more heat\n    *   the dark surface of the rock absorbs more insulation, leading to a rise in temperature\n    *   there is also a **positive feedback** loop: melting ice reduces albedo, so less reflection, and more energy is absorbed and hence an increase in temperature\n2. Differentiate between the greenhouse effect and global warming [2]\n    *   the **greenhouse effect is a natural effect** in which certain gases (water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and CFCs) allow SWR from the sun to pass through the atmosphere and heat up the path, but trap an increasing proportion of LWR from the earth\n    *   this radiation leads to the warming of the atmosphere, and is essential for our survival\n    *   in contrast, **global warming is an increase in temperature around the world**, that started in the 1960s, and has been going on most likely because of human activity\n3. Distinguish between global climate change and enhanced greenhouse effect [4]\n    *   Global climate (GCC) change is the _change in global patterns of climate_ (precipitation, temperature, wind, pressure systems)\n    *   Enhanced greenhouse (EGE) effect is the _increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of human activities_\n    *   GCC can have natural causes whereas the EGG is anthropogenic\n    *   GCC can relate to any aspect of climate whereas the EGE specifically impacts upon temperature\n    *   GCC can involve cooling periods whereas EGE is associated with global warming\n    *   EGE is a major cause of GCC\n4. Explain how deforestation may contribute to global warming [3]\n    *   deforestation releases carbon dioxide are removes a valuable carbon sink\n    *   this increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\n    *   carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas linked to global warming as it helps raise the quantity of heat retained by the atmosphere\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n1. This question is about soil degradation\n    1. State likely causes of soil degradation\n        *   overgrazing, agriculture, overexploitation of vegetation for fuelwood deforestation, salinization, urban growth, industrialization\n    2. Explain socio-economic consequences of soil degradation\n        *   loss of agriculture productivity of land acts as push factors to migration\n        *   loss of agriculture productivity, food shortages, famine, push factor, farmers too weak to work, other farmers discouraged from farming, less farmers so even less food\n        *   reduced aquifer recharge damages farmers’ incomes and water access\n        *   loss of employment, increased poverty in an area\n        *   creates environmental refugees, problems of displaced populations\n2. This question is about the climate change of an increase in 2ºC in sub-Saharan Africa\n3. Outline the likely changes in crop production in sub-Saharan Africa, if there is a temperature increase of 2ºC [2]\n    *   40–80% of maize, millet, and sorghum crops lost\n    *   reduction in crop production of wheat, maize, and sorghum (change in agriculture patterns)\n4. Suggest reasons for the changes outlined in (a) [2]\n    *   increased temperature causes an increase in evaporation, which causes a reduction in moisture levels, and hence an increase in erosivity (so less plants grown)\n    *   because of droughts due to high evaporation and less moisture, the soil loses important nutrients for plant growth and hence reduces the fertile content of the soil\n    *   the decrease in crop productivity discourages farmers from farming, so in the future there will be less farmers, and hence an even lower crop productivity\n    *   because of human population growth, more farmland must be used for buildings and other infrastructural development; agricultural land is used up\n    *   there can also be extreme heat waves in the summer making soil drier than normal with less water and nutrients\n5. Explain why there could be a decrease in biodiversity\n    *   there are less plants due to the increase in moistures and decrease in nutrients from the soil, so herbivores are affected; there could be a loss in grazing land\n    *   because herbivores are lower in number because of less food, food webs are affected and even carnivores are reduced in population\n    *   an increase in temperature causes an increase in drought conditions\n    *   decertification and desert migration takes place––desert migration reduces the fertile content of the soil (there is an increase in silica, making the soil less fertile)\n    *   this desertification causes a loss of Savanna, which is a more suitable habitat for many plants and animals than the desert\n6. Explain one social problem that court result from climate change in sub-Saharan Africa [2]\n    *   climate changes in sub-Saharan Africa may cause many farmers to stop farming and migrate to urban areas\n    *   farmers will produce less food and receive less money and become impoverished; they might look for alternative employment in urban areas\n    *   climate change may lead to malnutrition, especially in farmers who get too weak to work\n    *   malnourished mothers will give birth to underweight children, and they could have mental problems, so their life chances are badly affected\n\n\n# Global resource consumption and security\n\n\n\n1. Explain how demand for energy resources is changing [3]\n    *   Geographical pattern of demand is projected to shift from the OECD region to NICs\n    *   Demand for and use of energy resources by NICs has been rapidly increasing, although HICs are major consumers\n    *   Energy resources are used in large quantities for manufacturing and transporting in MICs and NICs\n    *   LICs and MICs continue to grow faster than HICs but their consumption remains low by comparison\n2. Explain why the ecological footprint of HICs is greater than that of LICs [6]\n    *   Smaller rates of resource consumption in LICs\n    *   In HICs people have more **disposable income**, so they have a higher consumption and demand for energy resources\n    *   HIC resource use is often **more wasteful** and they produce more pollution\n    *   People in LICs have less to spend on consumption, and the **informal economy **is responsible for **recycling** many resources\n    *   HICs have a meat-eating diet; 30% of the diet may be based on animal protein, and this way only a small amount of energy is transported to the people\n    *   Greenhouse gas emissions affect the footprint; HICs import and export more which leads to more transport which releases greenhouse gases\n3. Explain food security [2]\n    *   The availability and access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food\n    *   To meet the dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\n4. Explain the limitations of recycling as a strategy to reduce global resource consumption [3]\n    *   Energy still consumed in transportation (import and export) of waste to recycling centers\n    *   Energy used for recycling process\n    *   Some materials can’t be recycled or are too expensive\n    *   Recycling not available at a large enough scale to deal with all the waste\n    *   There may be better alternatives: substitution, lower consumption\n    *   Desire for economic growth greater than desire for sustainability\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n1. This question is about malthus and other theories\n    1. Explain the neo-Malthusian view of the relationship between population size and resource consumption. [4]\n        *   Neo = contemporary supporters of views of Malthus\n        *   Human population has a carrying capacity\n        *   Because it increases geometrically while resources increase arithmetically\n        *   Leading to check (positive or preventive), or a need for anti-natalist policies\n    2.

Examine the strengths and limitations of the energy efficiency ratio as an indicator of sustainable agriculture. [E]\n    *   Energy efficiency ratio is a measure of the amount of energy input into a farming system compared with the energy outputs. A ration of greater than 1 is considered efficient, as outputs will be greater than inputs\n    *   Inputs into the system include labor, machinery, fertilizers, irrigation, and fuel, while outputs refer to the quantity/yield of food that is produced\n    *   Energy efficiency ratios differ for many farmer systems around the world, capital-intensive systems, such as irrigated rice farming, are likely to have high inputs and high yields, and might be considered as efficient\n    *   Subsistence farming systems with high inputs of labor, might also be regarded as efficient if the outputs are high\n    *   Energy efficiency ratios differ for many farming systems around the world. Capital-intensive systems, such as irrigated rice farming, are likely to have high inputs and high yields, and might be considered as efficient. Subsistence farming systems, with high inputs of labour, might also be regarded as efficient if the outputs are high.\n    *   Farming systems differ in their EERs and their relative sustainability. EER might be a good indicator of the efficiency of a farming system, but it neglects the wider environmental and social impacts of farming. Agricultural systems that have a high EER might produce plentiful food supplies, but they are not necessarily sustainable. The farming system might have an adverse impact on the land or water – for example, irrigation might lead to salinization and depletion of groundwater; pesticides might result in eutrophication, and soil quality might be degraded.\n\n\n# Other skills\n\n\n\n1.

Higher altitudes do not provide suitable conditions for living as they are often too cold for crops to grow\n    *   Apart from certain farmers such as hill sheep farms, most farmers are at lower altitudes as fruits stay ripe for longer, and the conditions are better for livestock.\n    *   People in poverty are sometimes forced to live on mountains, which are more prone to the geophysical hazard of mass movements (landslides, mud slides, and they cannot move because of the lack of possibilities)\n*   <10% in the **southern hemisphere**: there is a higher proportion of land above the equator (around 67%)\n    *   Furthermore, there are deserts such as the Australian Outback and the Antarctic region, which do not provide suitable conditions\n    *   The desert is too hot and contains various species of venomous spiders.\n*   **Fertile soils**: they are better for farmers as they provide more nutrients for crops\n    *   The most preferred areas include areas such as the **Nile valley** as the river floodplains provide alluvial soil, along with a natural source of water.\n\n\n## Population distribution at a national scale\n\n\n### China\n\n\n\n*   There is uneven distribution: 11% of the population live on 0.5% of the land, and 50% live on 8.2% of the land because of the **physical geography**; less than 4% of the population live inland in places such as Tibet and Inner Mongolia\n    *   Only a small amount of the land is able to provide for rainfed agriculture, and much of the other land is too steep to dry/arid for agriculture, such as the east of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau \n*   Through internal migration, between **1990 and 95**,** 10 million** people moved **from rural areas to urban areas closer to the coast**, as these places had more **opportunities**\n    *   There is a higher number of people living along the coasts of the South China Sea owing to the number of fish\n    *   More people move to Shanghai as it is more developed, in search of better jobs\n*   A good place includes the **Sichuan Basin**, near Chengdu, although it is in the center (anomaly)\n    *   It is known as the ‘rice bowl’ of China\n    *   It has a population of **171 million** owing to the fertile soils and rainfall sufficient for growing rice\n    *   It also contains the ‘Sichuan Basin’, or Hongpen for water for irrigation, allowing the economy to be self-sufficient\n*   Mega-regions are being created, which hold megacities and millionaire cities, such as the **Liaoning mega-region** with around **30 million inhabitants**\n    *   These mega-regions are more concentrated towards the east of the country, reinforcing the inequality between east and west\n*   However, in 2020, people are expected to migrate towards the eastern, coastal regions of China (rural to urban internal migration) – it is predicted that there will be over 350 million urban inhabitants by 2020.\n\n\n#### **Internal migration**\n\n\n\n*   Since 1978, **160 million** migrants left rural areas to seek work in urban areas – this was because the wages in urban areas were **40% higher**\n*   It is good for the economy and beneficial to migrants (higher wages and workforce, higher LE in urban areas), although the environment is affected with increasing levels of air pollution\n    *   For example, the usage of coal is an issue as it releases dangerous sulfur dioxide and smog\n    *   Furthermore, in 2012, the waste generation in China was 300 million tonnes, along with 2.3 million tonnes of electronic waste owing to the enhanced economy and technological development.\n\nExample: **Shenzhen** (in the south-east) was a settlement of a few thousand people and by 2010, its population had reached 12 million, and is predicted to reach 15 million by 2012\n\n\n\n*   It is a megaregion due to the high population\n\n\n### South Africa\n\n\n\n*   Similar to China, South Africa has uneven population distribution due to internal migration\n    *   **Gauteng**, an economic region, has a population density of **over 1,000/km<sup>2</sup>** while areas in the **Northern Cape Province** have densities of less than **5/km<sup>2</sup>**\n    *   Only 65% of the population of **Gauteng** are born in the province, and the rest comprise of migrants and internal migrants.\n*   **Durban** is the third most populated city in South Africa\n    *   It has a higher population density of 2,600/km<sup>2</sup> as it has mineral resources including gold and diamonds\n    *   In 2015, it was recognised as one of the **New7Wonders Cities**.\n*   In SA, the population increases from the north-west to the south-east, reflecting partially the rainfall distribution\n\n\n###### Internal migration\n\n\n\n*   In 1950, internal economic migration took place from _ to _\n*   The **apartheid movement** caused forced migration of the blacks\n    *   Between 1948 and 94, National Party has political control of SA, and they forcibly moved 4 million blacks from “white areas”\n    *   There were “influx controls”, restricting black people from entering white towns\n    *   However, after 1994, blacks have migrated to larger cities such as **Cape Town** in search of better employment opportunities.\n\n\n# The demographic transition model\n\n\n\n*   It is a model used to describe the transition through which European countries has passed in the progression from an agrarian to a modern society. It has been applied to LICs and is used to predict the future population sizes and patterns.\n\n\n## Applying the DTM to Europe\n\n\n### Historically\n\n\n\n*   It suggests that fertility decline is closely linked to socio-economic modernization such as literacy, and degree of urbanization. A study of the **Walloon** and **Flemish** communities in **Belgium** found examples of communities with similar characteristics ut with widely varying fertility rates, which showed that **culture** was a dominating factor. \n*   Evidence from the **European** **Fertility Project** shows that fertility transition occurs under a great diversity of socio-economic conditions, suggesting that **diffusion** within a specific cultural or linguistic region is dominant factors in the onset of the fertility transition.\n\n\n### Future\n\n\n\n*   Many developed countries currently have birth-rates below the replacement level\n*   Some governments are also introducing pronatalist policies to counteract population decline\n*   The low trend in the could be followed by an upward trends as women “catch-up” in producing missing births, although this hypothesis cannot be evaluated.\n\n\n### The UK\n\n\n#### Birth rate rising (1700–1840)\n\n\n\n*   Improvements in recording births and deaths in the natural census in 1811\n*   Early stages of industrialization, so strong economic advantages of having children as they could contribute to the family by working in factories and mines – incentive to produce more children \n\n\n#### Death rate rises slightly (1820–1840)\n\n\n\n*   Fluctuating deaths in the 19th century as many diseases incurable and epidemics occurred periodically\n*   Death rate peaks coincide with the two World Wars\n\n\n#### Rise in birth rate in the (1950s)\n\n\n\n*   In 1945–50, the birth rate peak corresponds to the post-war “baby boom” in Europe\n*   Increasing number of working in the seventies, so the birth rate may have been elevated later by such women making  alate decision to have a family\n\n\n### Developing countries\n\nThere is a pattern when applying the model to developing countries:\n\n\n\n*   Mortality and transitions happen 3x or 4x faster usually: this is because:\n    *    “imported” medical knowledge or technology rather than being dependent on internal advances,\n    *    Role of the government, especially in China and Singapore, in promoting a decreased fertility\n    *    Education programmes aimed at women have resulted in delayed marriage and first birthday as well as increased availability of contraception\n\n\n# Megacities\n\n\n\n*   A **megacity** is a city with a population exceeding 8 million, and one that has diversified in function\n*   By 1990, there were 20 megacities, 14 in the developing world\n\n\n## Problems\n\n\n\n*   Lack of access to clean water, inadequate housing, harmful health effects of air pollution\n*   In Jakarta, Indonesia, over 1 million people do not have access to piped water or to a well. Over-abstraction from the city’s aquifer has resulted in subsidence of many areas of the city (30% of the population depends on this). Despite attempts made the government to control vehicle emissions, the entire population of the city is still exposed to levels of particular exceeding the WHO.\n*   In developing and developed countries, megacities exhibit social problems such as violence, drug abuse\n\n\n## Factors affecting growth of megacities\n\n\n### Colonial influences\n\n\n\n*   Creation of coastal cities in previous non-urban areas by invaders\n*   The Spanish and Portuguese created Lima and Buenos Aires which grew as Europeans flocked to the ‘new world’ to seek their fortunes, Rio de janeiro\n\n\n### Ports and trading cities\n\n\n\n*   Developed from the 1600 to the 1800s\n*   Shanghai: export of cotton ,silk, textiles; Sa Paolo: coffee which stimulated rapid growth\n\n\n### Reassignment of city as capital\n\n\n\n*   Prior to the independence of Bangladesh, Dhaka was the eastern regional administration capital and old trade center\n*   In 1950 the population of 430,000, and independence was gained in 1971, and in 1975 the population shut up to 2.3 million\n*   Annual growth of 7.25%, predicted to be magaity by 2020\n\n\n### Post independence policies frequently favored urban areas over rural\n\n\n\n*   industrialization/import substitution became the dominant post independence development strategy sa terms of trade has begun to favor Britain and US\n*   These industries drew labor from rural areas overseas\n\n\n### Post-war modernization and industrialization\n\n\n\n*   The World Depresion of the 1930s following the Wall Street Crash and effects of WW2 encouraged industrialization in developing countries, particularly Latin AMerica\n*   Industrialized nations needed manufacturing goods as their own factories were converted for war production, thus creating a ready market from Latin American exports, which in turn created wealth to back import substitution\n\n\n### Declining mortality rates\n\n\n\n*   Adult and infant mortality rates had fallen in both urban and rural areas as a result of modern public health measures and imported measures\n*   Developing countries were also able to reduce the rates as they could import technology and medical equipment to treat diseases\n*   Urban population because to live longer, and rural to urban migration increases;\n\n\n### Rural to urban migration\n\n\n\n*   Classic push and pull factors related to lack of land, war, famine, higher standards of long and better access to series, training, and employment have been responsible for urban growth in all developing countries\n*   Rural to urban migration accounted for 20% of the groht of Buenos Aires between 1940 and 1980\n\n\n### Settlement laws\n\n\n\n*   A China household registration system was enforced in 1050s which classified the urban population as Entitled and allowed access to subsidies and welfare to rural population as they were Non-Entitled\n*   The Entitled urban section became very attractive where levels of consumption were 3 times higher than the countryside, so migration to the cities grew\n\n\n## Advantages and disadvantages\n\n<div class=\"responsive-table\">\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Advantages\n   </td>\n   <td>Disadvantages\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Allows concentration of <strong>industry and finance</strong>.

after Calcutta\n*   The 2011 census states that the population was over 12 million\n*   Was developed as a deep water port by East India Company and export channel for Indian textiles\n    *   19th century: city grew as piracy suppressed, steamships arrived, and Western Ghats were crossed by rails in 1850s.\n*   New industrial employment drew migrants from India, Europe, and Middle East\n*   Mumbai currency accounts for **25%** of India's industrial output\n    *   Many TNCs such as the **Tata Group** are based in Mumbai\n    *   Mumbai is home to the **Bombay Stock Exchange**, the** Reserve Bank of India**, and **National Stock Exchange of India**\n    *   It also contains India’s scientific and nuclear industries of atomic energy, such as the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)\n*   However there are a significant number of slums: **9 out of the 12 million people** live in slums\n    *   **Dharavi**, Asia’s greatest slum is found here where 77% of households have an average of 5.3 people/room\n    *   The slum is a home to over **700,000 people** and only few people have jobs such as plumbing, and the largest industry is receding.\n*   Service provision is inadequate, and pollution levels are high: \n    *   **2 M** people live with no sewage facilities\n    *   Despite the number of people employed in recycling, **5,000 tonnes** of rubbish are produced everyday\n    *   Sewage is not treated before dispersed in the Arabian Sea; industrial pollution blamed for increasing incidents of respiratory and skin disease\n*   Most of the problems were caused by **rapid city growth**: \n    *   Poverty\n    *   Unemployment and underemployment\n    *   Limited access to healthcare and education\n    *   Poor sanitation and electricity\n    *   Diseases: up to **4,000 causes of diphtheria **and **typhoid** a day\n\n\n# Forced migration\n\n\n\n*   **Forced migration** is the movement of refugees and internally-displaced people (people displaced by natural/environmental disasters, famine, or development projects)\n*   There are several types:\n    *   **Conflict-induced displacement**: people forced to move due to armed conflict (civil war, violence, or persecution) on the basis of their nationality, race, religion, political opinion, or social group\n    *   **Development-induced displacement**: people are forced to move as a result of large-scale infrastructure projects (dams, airports)\n    *   **Disaster-induced displacement**: natural disasters resulting in large numbers of displaced people\n*   There are different types of forced migrants:\n    *   **Refugees**: a person residing outside his/her country of nationality, unable or unwilling to return because of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a political social group of political opinion\n    *   **Asylum seekers**: a person who has left their country of origin in search of protection in another country\n    *   **Internally displaced persons (IDPs)**: people who have been forced to flee their home suddenly or unexpectedly in large numbers as a result of armed conflict, internal strife, systematic violations of human rights, or natural or manmade disasters, and who are within the territory of their own country\n    *   **Development displacees**: people compelled to move as a result of policies and projects to promote development\n    *   **Environmental and disaster displacees**\n    *   **Smuggled people**: people moved illegally for profit\n    *   **Trafficked people**: people moved by deception and coercion for the purpose of exploitation and profit\n\n\n## Case study: Forced migration in and from Syria\n\n\n\n*   The repression of the ruling Assad regime and the emergence of the fundamentalist Islamic and group ISIS have led to the displacement of over 10 million people\n*   The Syrian conflict began as a civil war, but extended to include parts of Iraq when ISIS declared Syria and Iraq an Islamic “caliphate”\n*   Syrians near Damascus feared that government forces were being used on their own people, whereas in other parts of Syria, people feared that he would be killed, captured or forced to live under a severe and harsh Islamic rule\n\n\n# Aging populations\n\n\n\n*   Aging populations have both challenges and opportunities associated with them\n*   The elderly make the “grey economy” and hae many firms (holiday companies, health care)\n*   By 2035, the number of over 65s is expected to double to **1.3 billion**, from **7 to 14%** of the world's population\n*   The shift to an increasing number of aged people is due to **high fertility levels** after WW2 and **health improvements** that are reducing death rates at older ages\n*   Europe is currently the greatest continent with 23 of the world’s 25 oldest countries\n*   The **older dependency ratios** (ODR) acts as an indicator of the balance between working age people and the older population that they must support\n\n\n## Case study: Japan\n\n\n\n*   Number of elderly in Japan has increased from **0.8 million in 1975 to 2.5 in 2000**\n    *   Since 1975 the percentage of young people has gradually decreased\n    *   26% of the Japanese population are aged over 65 years in age, creating a burden on pension funds and social welfare programs\n*   There are many causes for this:\n    *   **High life expectancy**, which was 85 in 2016; and the overall population is shrinking due to lower fertility rates, and the aging population is rapidly increasing through improved nutrition, advanced medical and pharmacological technologies to prevent diseases\n        *   There was also massive economic growth following WW2, leading to longer lifespans (from 52 to 85 in 2016)\n    *   **Lower fertility rates**: in 2016, the TFR was 1.4 children per woman, due to the “_tempo_ effect”, which is caused by the timing of births, and most women are being married later, after being educated\n*   The high elderly population creates many problems:\n    *   Inadequate nursing facilities for the elderly as one doctor has to support many more patients\n        *   This has also lead to the creation of nursing homes and adult daycare centers (and home health programs): Japan closes **400 primary and secondary schools** per year, converting some of them to care centers for the elderly\n    *   Depletion of the labor force as there are more elderly and less young, so one worker has to support more older people\n        *   This further leads to a **deterioration of the economy**, as the silver population grows\n        *   The population pyramid has been inverted, with a bulge at the top, leading to the narrow base of young people having to provide care and support for a larger older cohort: the dependency ratio is increasing\n        *   There are 125 jobs for every 100 job seekers as of 2015\n    *   Many elderly live alone and isolated, leading unnoticed deaths (solitary death) (for many weeks)\n\n\n## Case study: China’s one-child policy\n\n\n## Case study: Japan’s pro-natalist policies\n\n\n\n*   Child Benefit Act of 1972: gave parents a 3000 yen contribution for starting a family\n    *   Aided in the financial security and well-being of children\n\n\n## Case study: Literacy and gender equality policies in Kerala\n\n\n# Anti-trafficking policies\n\n\n\n*   Increase awareness of traffickers and the problems associated\n*   Design policies to prevent trafficking: this includes up-to-date registration of births and migration into an area\n*   Allow trade union to protect rights in order to reduce trafficking\n*   Criminalise trafficking: jin the 2003 UN protocol to Prevent, Support, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children\n*   However, it can be difficult to manage trafficking\n    *   Areas such as Africa and the Middle East have such large populations, so the number of people unprotected is very large\n    *   Some (large) populations only have partial coverage\n*   There are many populations at risk of trafficking\n    *   Refugees and migrants: the overburdened asylum systems in Europe have provided opportunities for traffickers to continue to operate\n    *   LGBTI people and religious minorities\n    *   People with disabilities\n    *   Stateless people\n\n\n# The demographic dividend\n\n\n\n*   The **demographic dividend** refers to a bulge in the number of adults in a population, occurring when the fertility rates decline, allowing faster economic growth\n*   The lag between fertility provides a bulge in the population that surges through age groups \n*   This bulge increases the dependency ratio, and then eventually enters the work force\n*   The demographic dividend provides many **benefits**\n    *   Increased labor supply\n    *   Healthier women as the **TFR reduces** and because there are fewer societal and economic pressures\n        *   This allows parents to invest more resources per child, leading to better health and educational outcomes\n        *   Family planning helps delay to first pregnancy, thus improving the health of both the mother and the child\n        *   Educated women are more likely to work outside home, increasing the size of the labor force and their potential for economic development\n    *   **Inverses** **GDP per capita** as the workforce increases\n    *   More **tax revenue** for the government\n    *   Increases savings as the number of dependents decline\n*   **Achieving** the demographic dividend\n    *   Countries must substantially lower both BR and child DR\n    *   Focus on producing women with voluntary family planning information and services\n        *   **1 in 4** women in developing countries wants avoid being pregnant or delay childbirth but are not using modern family planning methods\n        *   Thailand invested in voluntary family planning, contraceptive use increased,leading to a reduced TFR from 5.5 to 2.2\n    *   Invest in child survival and health programmes\n    *   Commit to volnaretry family planning needs of both married and unmarried growth\n    *   Prioritizing education, especially secondary education for girls\n*   However, certain problems occur **after** the demographic dividend\n    *   The dependency ratio rises again as the population cohort created grows old and retires\n    *   A disproportionate number of old people rely upon a smaller generation \n    *   This is seen dramatically in **Japan**, with an aging population\n\n\n## Case study: South Korea’s demographic dividend\n\n\n\n*   SK made a rapid transition from reducing the TFR between 1960–90 through investing in health programmes, education and economic policies to create infrastructure and manufacturing\n*   SK followed an aggressive population policy\n    *   **Investment in health centers** to provide a range of services including family planning\n        *   Field workers visited homes and provided family planning information and methods\n    *   People saw that having fewer children improved life, and the fertility dropped from 5.4 to 2.9 to 1.2 per woman\n    *   The governments also focused on **education** between the 1960–80s\n        *   A “production-oriented” education would provide people with skills and knowledge to achieve economic development\n    *   At the same time, the **economic plans** were comprehensive\n        *   In the 50s, SK’s economic plans were based heavily on farming, fishing, and was weak\n        *   Improved relations with Japan led to investment capital that strengthened agricultural fishing and manufacturing industries, including shipping \n        *   The government also addressed unemployment through rural construct that provided minimum wages for workers involved in the construction of infrastructure including dams and roads\n            *   This leads to the development of a national infrastructure and economic growth",html:"<h1>Population and economic development patterns</h1>\n<h2>Factors affecting population

infrastructure projects (dams, airports)</li>\n<li><strong>Disaster-induced displacement</strong>: natural disasters resulting in large numbers of displaced people</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are different types of forced migrants:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Refugees</strong>: a person residing outside his/her country of nationality, unable or unwilling to return because of a well-founded fear of

billion</strong>, from <strong>7 to 14%</strong> of the world's population</li>\n<li>The shift to an increasing number of aged people is due to <strong>high fertility levels</strong> after WW2 and <strong>health improvements</strong> that are reducing death rates at older ages</li>\n<li>Europe is currently the greatest continent with 23 of the world’s 25 oldest countries</li>\n<li>The

this:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High life expectancy</strong>, which was 85 in 2016; and the overall population is shrinking due to lower fertility rates, and the aging population is rapidly increasing through improved nutrition, advanced medical and pharmacological technologies to prevent diseases\n<ul>\n<li>There was also massive economic growth following WW2, leading to longer lifespans (from 52 to 85 in 2016)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Lower fertility rates</strong>: in 2016, the TFR was 1.4 children per woman, due to the “<em>tempo</em> effect”, which is caused by the timing of births, and most women are being married later, after being educated</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The high elderly population creates many problems:\n<ul>\n<li>Inadequate nursing facilities for the elderly as one doctor has to support many more patients\n<ul>\n<li>This has also lead to the creation of nursing homes and adult daycare centers (and home health programs): Japan closes <strong>400 primary and secondary schools</strong> per year, converting some of them to care centers for the elderly</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Depletion of the labor force as there are more elderly and less young, so one worker has to support more older people\n<ul>\n<li>This further leads to a <strong>deterioration of the economy</strong>, as the silver population grows</li>\n<li>The population pyramid has been inverted, with a bulge at the top, leading to the narrow base of young people having to provide care and support for a larger older cohort: the dependency ratio is increasing</li>\n<li>There are 125 jobs for every 100 job seekers as of 2015</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Many elderly live alone and isolated, leading unnoticed deaths (solitary death) (for many weeks)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Case

groups</li>\n<li>This bulge increases the dependency ratio, and then eventually enters the work force</li>\n<li>The demographic dividend provides many <strong>benefits</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased labor supply</li>\n<li>Healthier women as the <strong>TFR reduces</strong> and because there are fewer societal and economic pressures\n<ul>\n<li>This allows parents to invest more resources per child, leading to better health and educational outcomes</li>\n<li>Family planning helps delay to first pregnancy, thus improving the health of both the mother and the child</li>\n<li>Educated women

distribution\n\n\n\n*   **Distance from the sea**: 75% of the population live within 1,000 km of the sea, and more people are moving towards the sea\n    *   For example, in China, through internal migration, between **1990 and 95**,** 10 million** people moved **from rural areas to urban areas closer to the coast**, as these places had more **opportunities** [see CS below].\n*   **Altitude**: 85% live less than 500 m. Higher altitudes do not provide suitable conditions for living as they are often too cold for crops to grow\n    *   Apart from certain farmers such as hill sheep farms, most farmers are at lower altitudes as fruits stay ripe for longer, and the conditions are better for livestock.\n    *   People in poverty are sometimes forced to live on mountains, which are more prone to the geophysical hazard of mass movements (landslides, mud slides, and they cannot move because of the lack of possibilities)\n*   <10% in the **southern hemisphere**: there is a higher proportion of land above the equator (around 67%)\n    *   Furthermore, there are deserts such as the Australian Outback and the Antarctic region, which do not provide suitable conditions\n    *   The desert is too hot and contains various species of venomous spiders.\n*   **Fertile soils**: they are better for farmers as they provide more nutrients for crops\n    *   The most preferred areas include areas such as the **Nile valley** as the river floodplains provide alluvial soil, along with a natural source of water.\n\n\n## Population distribution at a national scale\n\n\n### China\n\n\n\n*   There is uneven distribution: 11% of the population live on 0.5% of the land, and 50% live on 8.2% of the land because of the **physical geography**; less than 4% of the population live inland in places such as Tibet and Inner Mongolia\n    *   Only a small amount of the land is able to provide for rainfed agriculture, and much of the other land is too steep to dry/arid for agriculture, such as the east of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau \n*   Through internal migration, between **1990 and 95**,** 10 million** people moved **from rural areas to urban areas closer to the coast**, as these places had more **opportunities**\n    *   There is a higher number of people living along the coasts of the South China Sea owing to the number of fish\n    *   More people move to Shanghai as it is more developed, in search of better jobs\n*   A good place includes the **Sichuan Basin**, near Chengdu, although it is in the center (anomaly)\n    *   It is known as the ‘rice bowl’ of China\n    *   It has a population of **171 million** owing to the fertile soils and rainfall sufficient for growing rice\n    *   It also contains the ‘Sichuan Basin’, or Hongpen for water for irrigation, allowing the economy to be self-sufficient\n*   Mega-regions are being created, which hold megacities and millionaire cities, such as the **Liaoning mega-region** with around **30 million inhabitants**\n    *   These mega-regions are more concentrated towards the east of the country, reinforcing the inequality between east and west\n*   However, in 2020, people are expected to migrate towards the eastern, coastal regions of China (rural to urban internal migration) – it is predicted that there will be over 350 million urban inhabitants by 2020.\n\n\n#### **Internal migration**\n\n\n\n*   Since 1978, **160 million** migrants left rural areas to seek work in urban areas – this was because the wages in urban areas were **40% higher**\n*   It is good for the economy and beneficial to migrants (higher wages and workforce, higher LE in urban areas), although the environment is affected with increasing levels of air pollution\n    *   For example, the usage of coal is an issue as it releases dangerous sulfur dioxide and smog\n    *   Furthermore, in 2012, the waste generation in China was 300 million tonnes, along with 2.3 million tonnes of electronic waste owing to the enhanced economy and technological development.\n\nExample: **Shenzhen** (in the south-east) was a settlement of a few thousand people and by 2010, its population had reached 12 million, and is predicted to reach 15 million by 2012\n\n\n\n*   It is a megaregion due to the high population\n\n\n### South Africa\n\n\n\n*   Similar to China, South Africa has uneven population distribution due to internal migration\n    *   **Gauteng**, an economic region, has a population density of **over 1,000/km<sup>2</sup>** while areas in the **Northern Cape Province** have densities of less than **5/km<sup>2</sup>**\n    *   Only 65% of the population of **Gauteng** are born in the province, and the rest comprise of migrants and internal migrants.\n*   **Durban** is the third most populated city in South Africa\n    *   It has a higher population density of 2,600/km<sup>2</sup> as it has mineral resources including gold and diamonds\n    *   In 2015, it was recognised as one of the **New7Wonders Cities**.\n*   In SA, the population increases from the north-west to the south-east, reflecting partially the rainfall distribution\n\n\n###### Internal migration\n\n\n\n*   In 1950, internal economic migration took place from _ to _\n*   The **apartheid movement** caused forced migration of the blacks\n    *   Between 1948 and 94, National Party has political control of SA, and they forcibly moved 4 million blacks from “white areas”\n    *   There were “influx controls”, restricting black people from entering white towns\n    *   However, after 1994, blacks have migrated to larger cities such as **Cape Town** in search of better employment opportunities.\n\n\n# The demographic transition model\n\n\n\n*   It is a model used to describe the transition through which European countries has passed in the progression from an agrarian to a modern society. It has been applied to LICs and is used to predict the future population sizes and patterns.\n\n\n## Applying the DTM to Europe\n\n\n### Historically\n\n\n\n*   It suggests that fertility decline is closely linked to socio-economic modernization such as literacy, and degree of urbanization. A study of the **Walloon** and **Flemish** communities in **Belgium** found examples of communities with similar characteristics ut with widely varying fertility rates, which showed that **culture** was a dominating factor. \n*   Evidence from the **European** **Fertility Project** shows that fertility transition occurs under a great diversity of socio-economic conditions, suggesting that **diffusion** within a specific cultural or linguistic region is dominant factors in the onset of the fertility transition.\n\n\n### Future\n\n\n\n*   Many developed countries currently have birth-rates below the replacement level\n*   Some governments are also introducing pronatalist policies to counteract population decline\n*   The low trend in the could be followed by an upward trends as women “catch-up” in producing missing births, although this hypothesis cannot be evaluated.\n\n\n### The UK\n\n\n#### Birth rate rising (1700–1840)\n\n\n\n*   Improvements in recording births and deaths in the natural census in 1811\n*   Early stages of industrialization, so strong economic advantages of having children as they could contribute to the family by working in factories and mines – incentive to produce more children \n\n\n#### Death rate rises slightly (1820–1840)\n\n\n\n*   Fluctuating deaths in the 19th century as many diseases incurable and epidemics occurred periodically\n*   Death rate peaks coincide with the two World Wars\n\n\n#### Rise in birth rate in the (1950s)\n\n\n\n*   In 1945–50, the birth rate peak corresponds to the post-war “baby boom” in Europe\n*   Increasing number of working in the seventies, so the birth rate may have been elevated later by such women making  alate decision to have a family\n\n\n### Developing countries\n\nThere is a pattern when applying the model to developing countries:\n\n\n\n*   Mortality and transitions happen 3x or 4x faster usually: this is because:\n    *    “imported” medical knowledge or technology rather than being dependent on internal advances,\n    *    Role of the government, especially in China and Singapore, in promoting a decreased fertility\n    *    Education programmes aimed at women have resulted in delayed marriage and first birthday as well as increased availability of contraception\n\n\n# Megacities\n\n\n\n*   A **megacity** is a city with a population exceeding 8 million, and one that has diversified in function\n*   By 1990, there were 20 megacities, 14 in the developing world\n\n\n## Problems\n\n\n\n*   Lack of access to clean water, inadequate housing, harmful health effects of air pollution\n*   In Jakarta, Indonesia, over 1 million people do not have access to piped water or to a well. Over-abstraction from the city’s aquifer has resulted in subsidence of many areas of the city (30% of the population depends on this). Despite attempts made the government to control vehicle emissions, the entire population of the city is still exposed to levels of particular exceeding the WHO.\n*   In developing and developed countries, megacities exhibit social problems such as violence, drug abuse\n\n\n## Factors affecting growth of megacities\n\n\n### Colonial influences\n\n\n\n*   Creation of coastal cities in previous non-urban areas by invaders\n*   The Spanish and Portuguese created Lima and Buenos Aires which grew as Europeans flocked to the ‘new world’ to seek their fortunes, Rio de janeiro\n\n\n### Ports and trading cities\n\n\n\n*   Developed from the 1600 to the 1800s\n*   Shanghai: export of cotton ,silk, textiles; Sa Paolo: coffee which stimulated rapid growth\n\n\n### Reassignment of city as capital\n\n\n\n*   Prior to the independence of Bangladesh, Dhaka was the eastern regional administration capital and old trade center\n*   In 1950 the population of 430,000, and independence was gained in 1971, and in 1975 the population shut up to 2.3 million\n*   Annual growth of 7.25%, predicted to be magaity by 2020\n\n\n### Post independence policies frequently favored urban areas over rural\n\n\n\n*   industrialization/import substitution became the dominant post independence development strategy sa terms of trade has begun to favor Britain and US\n*   These industries drew labor from rural areas overseas\n\n\n### Post-war modernization and industrialization\n\n\n\n*   The World Depresion of the 1930s following the Wall Street Crash and effects of WW2 encouraged industrialization in developing countries, particularly Latin AMerica\n*   Industrialized nations needed manufacturing goods as their own factories were converted for war production, thus creating a ready market from Latin American exports, which in turn created wealth to back import substitution\n\n\n### Declining mortality rates\n\n\n\n*   Adult and infant mortality rates had fallen in both urban and rural areas as a result of modern public health measures and imported measures\n*   Developing countries were also able to reduce the rates as they could import technology and medical equipment to treat diseases\n*   Urban population because to live longer, and rural to urban migration increases;\n\n\n### Rural to urban migration\n\n\n\n*   Classic push and pull factors related to lack of land, war, famine, higher standards of long and better access to series, training, and employment have been responsible for urban growth in all developing countries\n*   Rural to urban migration accounted for 20% of the groht of Buenos Aires between 1940 and 1980\n\n\n### Settlement laws\n\n\n\n*   A China household registration system was enforced in 1050s which classified the urban population as Entitled and allowed access to subsidies and welfare to rural population as they were Non-Entitled\n*   The Entitled urban section became very attractive where levels of consumption were 3 times higher than the countryside, so migration to the cities grew\n\n\n## Advantages and disadvantages\n\n<div class=\"responsive-table\">\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Advantages\n   </td>\n   <td>Disadvantages\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Allows concentration of <strong>industry and finance</strong>.

have an average of 5.3 people/room\n    *   The slum is a home to over **700,000 people** and only few people have jobs such as plumbing, and the largest industry is receding.\n*   Service provision is inadequate, and pollution levels are high: \n    *   **2 M** people live with no sewage facilities\n    *   Despite the number of people employed in recycling, **5,000 tonnes** of rubbish are produced everyday\n    *   Sewage is not treated before dispersed in the Arabian Sea; industrial pollution blamed for increasing incidents of respiratory and skin disease\n*   Most of the problems were caused by **rapid city growth**: \n    *   Poverty\n    *   Unemployment and underemployment\n    *   Limited access to healthcare and education\n    *   Poor sanitation and electricity\n    *   Diseases: up to **4,000 causes of diphtheria **and **typhoid** a day\n\n\n# Forced migration\n\n\n\n*   **Forced migration** is the movement of refugees and internally-displaced people (people displaced by natural/environmental disasters, famine, or development projects)\n*   There are several types:\n    *   **Conflict-induced displacement**: people forced to move due to armed conflict (civil war, violence, or persecution) on the basis of their nationality, race, religion, political opinion, or social group\n    *   **Development-induced displacement**: people are forced to move as a result of large-scale infrastructure projects (dams, airports)\n    *   **Disaster-induced displacement**: natural disasters resulting in large numbers of displaced people\n*   There are different types of forced migrants:\n    *   **Refugees**: a person residing outside his/her country of nationality, unable or unwilling to return because of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a political social group of political opinion\n    *   **Asylum seekers**: a person who has left their country of origin in search of protection in another country\n    *   **Internally displaced persons (IDPs)**: people who have been forced to flee their home suddenly or unexpectedly in large numbers as a result of armed conflict, internal strife, systematic violations of human rights, or natural or manmade disasters, and who are within the territory of their own country\n    *   **Development displacees**: people compelled to move as a result of policies and projects to promote development\n    *   **Environmental and disaster displacees**\n    *   **Smuggled people**: people moved illegally for profit\n    *   **Trafficked people**: people moved by deception and coercion for the purpose of exploitation and profit\n\n\n## Case study: Forced migration in and from Syria\n\n\n\n*   The repression of the ruling Assad regime and the emergence of the fundamentalist Islamic and group ISIS have led to the displacement of over 10 million people\n*   The Syrian conflict began as a civil war, but extended to include parts of Iraq when ISIS declared Syria and Iraq an Islamic “caliphate”\n*   Syrians near Damascus feared that government forces were being used on their own people, whereas in other parts of Syria, people feared that he would be killed, captured or forced to live under a severe and harsh Islamic rule\n\n\n# Aging populations\n\n\n\n*   Aging populations have both challenges and opportunities associated with them\n*   The elderly make the “grey economy” and hae many firms (holiday companies, health care)\n*   By 2035, the number of over 65s is expected to double to **1.3 billion**, from **7 to 14%** of the world's population\n*   The shift to an increasing number of aged people is due to **high fertility levels** after WW2 and **health improvements** that are reducing death rates at older ages\n*   Europe is currently the greatest continent with 23 of the world’s 25 oldest countries\n*   The **older dependency ratios** (ODR) acts as an indicator of the balance between working age people and the older population that they must support\n\n\n## Case study: Japan\n\n\n\n*   Number of elderly in Japan has increased from **0.8 million in 1975 to 2.5 in 2000**\n    *   Since 1975 the percentage of young people has gradually decreased\n    *   26% of the Japanese population are aged over 65 years in age, creating a burden on pension funds and social welfare programs\n*   There are many causes for this:\n    *   **High life expectancy**, which was 85 in 2016; and the overall population is shrinking due to lower fertility rates, and the aging population is rapidly increasing through improved nutrition, advanced medical and pharmacological technologies to prevent diseases\n        *   There was also massive economic growth following WW2, leading to longer lifespans (from 52 to 85 in 2016)\n    *   **Lower fertility rates**: in 2016, the TFR was 1.4 children per woman, due to the “_tempo_ effect”, which is caused by the timing of births, and most women are being married later, after being educated\n*   The high elderly population creates many problems:\n    *   Inadequate nursing facilities for the elderly as one doctor has to support many more patients\n        *   This has also lead to the creation of nursing homes and adult daycare centers (and home health programs): Japan closes **400 primary and secondary schools** per year, converting some of them to care centers for the elderly\n    *   Depletion of the labor force as there are more elderly and less young, so one worker has to support more older people\n        *   This further leads to a **deterioration of the economy**, as the silver population grows\n        *   The population pyramid has been inverted, with a bulge at the top, leading to the narrow base of young people having to provide care and support for a larger older cohort: the dependency ratio is increasing\n        *   There are 125 jobs for every 100 job seekers as of 2015\n    *   Many elderly live alone and isolated, leading unnoticed deaths (solitary death) (for many weeks)\n\n\n## Case study: China’s one-child policy\n\n\n## Case study: Japan’s pro-natalist policies\n\n\n\n*   Child Benefit Act of 1972: gave parents a 3000 yen contribution for starting a family\n    *   Aided in the financial security and well-being of children\n\n\n## Case study: Literacy and gender equality policies in Kerala\n\n\n# Anti-trafficking policies\n\n\n\n*   Increase awareness of traffickers and the problems associated\n*   Design policies to prevent trafficking: this includes up-to-date registration of births and migration into an area\n*   Allow trade union to protect rights in order to reduce trafficking\n*   Criminalise trafficking: jin the 2003 UN protocol to Prevent, Support, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children\n*   However, it can be difficult to manage trafficking\n    *   Areas such as Africa and the Middle East have such large populations, so the number of people unprotected is very large\n    *   Some (large) populations only have partial coverage\n*   There are many populations at risk of trafficking\n    *   Refugees and migrants: the overburdened asylum systems in Europe have provided opportunities for traffickers to continue to operate\n    *   LGBTI people and religious minorities\n    *   People with disabilities\n    *   Stateless people\n\n\n# The demographic dividend\n\n\n\n*   The **demographic dividend** refers to a bulge in the number of adults in a population, occurring when the fertility rates decline, allowing faster economic growth\n*   The lag between fertility provides a bulge in the population that surges through age groups \n*   This bulge increases the dependency ratio, and then eventually enters the work force\n*   The demographic dividend provides many **benefits**\n    *   Increased labor supply\n    *   Healthier women as the **TFR reduces** and because there are fewer societal and economic pressures\n        *   This allows parents to invest more resources per child, leading to better health and educational outcomes\n        *   Family planning helps delay to first pregnancy, thus improving the health of both the mother and the child\n        *   Educated women are more likely to work outside home, increasing the size of the labor force and their potential for economic development\n    *   **Inverses** **GDP per capita** as the workforce increases\n    *   More **tax revenue** for the government\n    *   Increases savings as the number of dependents decline\n*   **Achieving** the demographic dividend\n    *   Countries must substantially lower both BR and child DR\n    *   Focus on producing women with voluntary family planning information and services\n        *   **1 in 4** women in developing countries wants avoid being pregnant or delay childbirth but are not using modern family planning methods\n        *   Thailand invested in voluntary family planning, contraceptive use increased,leading to a reduced TFR from 5.5 to 2.2\n    *   Invest in child survival and health programmes\n    *   Commit to volnaretry family planning needs of both married and unmarried growth\n    *   Prioritizing education, especially secondary education for girls\n*   However, certain problems occur **after** the demographic dividend\n    *   The dependency ratio rises again as the population cohort created grows old and retires\n    *   A disproportionate number of old people rely upon a smaller generation \n    *   This is seen dramatically in **Japan**, with an aging population\n\n\n## Case study: South Korea’s demographic dividend\n\n\n\n*   SK made a rapid transition from reducing the TFR between 1960–90 through investing in health programmes, education and economic policies to create infrastructure and manufacturing\n*   SK followed an aggressive population policy\n    *   **Investment in health centers** to provide a range of services including family planning\n        *   Field workers visited homes and provided family planning information and methods\n    *   People saw that having fewer children improved life, and the fertility dropped from 5.4 to 2.9 to 1.2 per woman\n    *   The governments also focused on **education** between the 1960–80s\n        *   A “production-oriented” education would provide people with skills and knowledge to achieve economic development\n    *   At the same time, the **economic plans** were comprehensive\n        *   In the 50s, SK’s economic plans were based heavily on farming, fishing, and was weak\n        *   Improved relations with Japan led to investment capital that strengthened agricultural fishing and manufacturing industries, including shipping \n        *   The government also addressed unemployment through rural construct that provided minimum wages for workers involved in the construction of infrastructure including dams and roads\n            *   This leads to the development of a national infrastructure and economic growth"},html:{writable:!0,enumerable:!0,value:"<h1>Population and economic development patterns</h1>\n<h2>Factors affecting

fundamentalist Islamic and group ISIS have led to the displacement of over 10 million people</li>\n<li>The Syrian conflict began as a civil war, but extended to include parts of Iraq when ISIS declared Syria and Iraq an Islamic “caliphate”</li>\n<li>Syrians near Damascus feared that government forces were being used on their own people, whereas in other parts of Syria, people feared that he would be killed, captured or forced to live under a severe and harsh Islamic rule</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Aging populations</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Aging populations have both challenges and opportunities associated with them</li>\n<li>The elderly make the “grey economy” and hae many firms (holiday companies, health care)</li>\n<li>By 2035, the number of over 65s is expected to double to <strong>1.3 billion</strong>, from <strong>7 to 14%</strong> of the world's population</li>\n<li>The shift to an increasing number of aged people is due to <strong>high fertility levels</strong> after WW2 and <strong>health improvements</strong> that are reducing death rates at older ages</li>\n<li>Europe is currently the greatest continent with 23 of the world’s 25 oldest countries</li>\n<li>The <strong>older dependency ratios</strong> (ODR) acts as an indicator of the balance between working age people and the older population that they must support</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Case study: Japan</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of elderly in Japan has increased from <strong>0.8 million in 1975 to 2.5 in 2000</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Since 1975 the percentage of young people has gradually decreased</li>\n<li>26% of the Japanese population are aged over 65 years in age, creating a burden on pension funds and social welfare programs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are many causes for this:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High life expectancy</strong>, which was 85 in 2016; and the overall population is shrinking due to lower fertility rates, and the aging population is rapidly increasing through improved nutrition, advanced medical and pharmacological technologies to prevent diseases\n<ul>\n<li>There was also massive economic growth following WW2, leading to longer lifespans (from 52 to 85 in 2016)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Lower fertility rates</strong>: in 2016, the TFR was 1.4 children per woman, due to the “<em>tempo</em> effect”, which is caused by the timing of births, and most women are being married later, after being educated</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The high elderly population creates many problems:\n<ul>\n<li>Inadequate nursing facilities for the elderly as one doctor has to support many more patients\n<ul>\n<li>This has also lead to the creation of nursing homes and adult daycare centers (and home health programs): Japan closes <strong>400 primary and secondary schools</strong> per year, converting some of them to care centers for the elderly</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Depletion of the labor force as there are more elderly and less young, so one worker has to support more older people\n<ul>\n<li>This further leads to a <strong>deterioration of the economy</strong>, as the silver population grows</li>\n<li>The population pyramid has been inverted, with a bulge at the top, leading to the narrow base of young people having to provide care and support for a larger older cohort: the dependency ratio is increasing</li>\n<li>There are 125 jobs for every 100 job seekers as of 2015</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Many elderly live alone and isolated, leading unnoticed deaths (solitary death) (for many weeks)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Case study: China’s one-child policy</h2>\n<h2>Case study: Japan’s pro-natalist policies</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Child Benefit Act of 1972: gave parents a 3000 yen contribution for starting a family\n<ul>\n<li>Aided in the financial security and well-being of children</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Case study: Literacy and gender equality policies in Kerala</h2>\n<h1>Anti-trafficking policies</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase awareness of traffickers and the problems associated</li>\n<li>Design policies to prevent trafficking: this includes up-to-date registration of births and migration into an area</li>\n<li>Allow trade union to protect rights in order to reduce trafficking</li>\n<li>Criminalise trafficking: jin the 2003 UN protocol to Prevent, Support, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children</li>\n<li>However, it can be difficult to manage trafficking\n<ul>\n<li>Areas such as Africa and the Middle East have such large populations, so the number of people unprotected is very large</li>\n<li>Some (large) populations only have partial coverage</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are many populations at risk of trafficking\n<ul>\n<li>Refugees and migrants: the overburdened asylum systems in Europe have provided opportunities for traffickers to continue to operate</li>\n<li>LGBTI people and religious minorities</li>\n<li>People with disabilities</li>\n<li>Stateless people</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>The demographic dividend</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>demographic dividend</strong> refers to a bulge in the number of adults in a population, occurring when the fertility rates decline, allowing faster economic growth</li>\n<li>The lag between fertility provides a bulge in the population that surges through age groups</li>\n<li>This bulge increases the dependency ratio, and then eventually enters the work force</li>\n<li>The demographic dividend provides many <strong>benefits</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased labor supply</li>\n<li>Healthier women as the <strong>TFR reduces</strong> and because there are fewer societal and economic pressures\n<ul>\n<li>This allows parents to invest more resources per child, leading to better health and educational outcomes</li>\n<li>Family planning helps delay to first pregnancy, thus improving the health of both the mother and the child</li>\n<li>Educated women are more likely to work outside home, increasing the size of the labor force and their potential for economic development</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Inverses</strong> <strong>GDP per capita</strong> as the workforce increases</li>\n<li>More <strong>tax revenue</strong> for the government</li>\n<li>Increases savings as the number of dependents decline</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Achieving</strong> the demographic dividend\n<ul>\n<li>Countries must substantially lower both BR and child DR</li>\n<li>Focus on producing women with voluntary family planning information and services\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1 in 4</strong> women in developing countries wants avoid being pregnant or delay childbirth but are not using modern family planning methods</li>\n<li>Thailand invested in voluntary family planning, contraceptive use increased,leading to a reduced TFR from 5.5 to 2.2</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Invest in child survival and health programmes</li>\n<li>Commit to volnaretry family planning needs of both married and unmarried growth</li>\n<li>Prioritizing education, especially secondary education for girls</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>However, certain problems occur <strong>after</strong> the demographic dividend\n<ul>\n<li>The dependency ratio rises again as the population cohort created grows old and retires</li>\n<li>A disproportionate number of old people rely upon a smaller generation</li>\n<li>This is seen dramatically in <strong>Japan</strong>, with an aging population</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Case study: South Korea’s demographic dividend</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>SK made a rapid transition from reducing the TFR between 1960–90 through investing in health programmes, education and economic policies to create infrastructure and manufacturing</li>\n<li>SK followed an aggressive population policy\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investment in health centers</strong> to provide a range of services including family planning\n<ul>\n<li>Field workers visited homes and provided family planning information and methods</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>People saw that having fewer children improved life, and the fertility dropped from 5.4 to 2.9 to 1.2 per woman</li>\n<li>The governments also focused on <strong>education</strong> between the 1960–80s\n<ul>\n<li>A “production-oriented” education would provide people with skills and knowledge to achieve economic development</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>At the same time, the <strong>economic plans</strong> were comprehensive\n<ul>\n<li>In the 50s, SK’s economic plans were based heavily on farming, fishing, and was weak</li>\n<li>Improved relations with Japan led to investment capital that strengthened agricultural fishing and manufacturing industries, including shipping</li>\n<li>The government also addressed unemployment through rural construct that provided minimum wages for workers involved in the construction of infrastructure including dams and roads\n<ul>\n<li>This leads to the development of a national infrastructure and economic growth</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"},attributes:{writable:!0,enumerable:!0,value:{title:"Unit 1 Changing

the Earth\n\n\n\n*   Thermosphere\n*   Atmosphere\n*   Stratosphere\n*   Troposphere\n\n\n### Atmospheric energy balance\n\n\n\n*   **Insolation** is incoming solar radiation\n*   Most of this energy in the tropical regions, whereas there is a loss in energy from poles\n*   There is a redistribution of energy from lower altitudes to higher latitudes by wind circulation and ocean currents\n*   Only 46% of energy is absorbed at the surface\n\n\n### Atmospheric energy balance\n\n\n\n*   There are three types of heat transfer\n    *   Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves\n    *   Convection is the transfer of heat by movement of gas or liquid\n    *   Conduction is the transfer of heat by contact\n*   Of **46%** of the insolation reaches the earth's atmosphere\n*   Reflection from the earth's surface is known as **planetary albedo** \n*   Energy received from the Sun by the Earth is re-radiate at a long wavelength\n\n\n### Incoming (short-wave) radiation\n\n\n\n*   **Insolation** is the main energy out, and it affected by latitude, season, and cloud cover\n    *   The less cloud cover, the more radiation reaches the Earth’s surface\n*   Short-wave radiation is not absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, they only heat up the Earth, which then predicted long-wave radiation\n\n\n### Long-wave radiation\n\n\n\n*   **Long-wave radiation** refers to the radiation of energy from the Earth (cold body) into the atmosphere\n*   During the day, outgoing long-wave radiation transfer is greater than the incoming long-wave transfer, so there is a net loss of energy\n*   On a cloudy night, clouds return some long-wave radiation to the surface, which reduced the overall loss of energy\n\n\n## The greenhouse effect\n\n\n\n*   The **greenhouse effect** is the process by which certain gases allow short-wave radiation from the Sun to pass through the atmosphere but trap an increasing proportion of outgoing long-wave radiation from the Earth\n\n\n### Greenhouse gases\n\n\n\n*   Water vapour: accounts for 50% of the greenhouse effect\n*   Carbon dioxide: from deforestation, as it removed tres that convert carbon dioxide to oxygen\n*   Methane: from cattle, wetlands\n*   Chlorofluorocarbons: destroy ozone\n\n\n## Changes in the global energy balance\n\n\n### Variations in solar radiation\n\n\n\n*   Changes in the output of energy from the sun (11-year cycle)\n*   Small variations in the Earth's orbit affect the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation (responsible for ice ages)\n*   Changes in atmospheric composition are linked to an increase in global temperature\n*   Changes in **albedo**, as the ice melts and is replaced by darker vegetation\n\n\n### Global dimming\n\n\n\n*   Air pollution has a cooling effect\n*   Natural particles in clean air provide condensation nuclei for water, and polluted air contains more particles than clean air, and therefore many more states for water to bind to\n*   The droplets are smaller than natural ones, meaning polluted clouds conant smaller water droplets, and hence reflect more sunlight, presenting the Sun’s heat from getting through the Earth's surface\n\n\n### Feedback loops\n\n\n\n1. Positive feedback\n    *   Ice caps\n        *   Melting of polar ice caps = lower albedo\n        *   Less ice = less reflection of radiation\n        *   So more energy absorbed, hence an increase in temperature\n    *   Melting ice and water\n        *   Melt Ice ice = more water = bigger waves\n        *   Larger waves break up sea ice\n        *   Water is less reflective, so more energy absorbed, hence an increase in temperature\n    *   Permafrost\n        *   Thawing of permafrost = increase in methane levels\n        *   Adding to the GHGs\n        *   So increase in temperature because heat is prevented from leaving\n2. Negative feedback\n    *   Burning, leading to more aerosols, and reduced solar radiation, causing cooling (global dimming)\n    *   Increased evaporation, leading to more cooling\n\nCase study: negative feedback in Greenland\n\n\n## Enhanced greenhouse effect\n\n\n\n*   The **enhanced greenhouse effect** is the impact of increasing levels of greenhouse gases as a result of human activities, often referred to as **global warming**\n*   The increase in the world's greenhouse gases is linked to industrialization, trade, and globalization\n\n\n# Consequences of global climate change\n\n\n## Implications\n\n\n\n*   Sea-level rise: floods to low-lying areas such as the Maldives, and Bangladesh\n*   Storm activity increase\n*   Agricultural patterns change: USA’s grain belt will shrink and production will decline, while Canada's goriing season will get longer and more productive\n*   Less rainfall over the USA, southern Europe, and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\n*   Up to **40%** of wildlife species will go extinct in the Amazon, Miombo woodlands of South Africa (African elephants, sundarban tigers, and also sea-animals such as sharks)\n\n\n### Hydrosphere\n\n\n\n*   Rise in sea-levels flooding low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, Netherlands, Egypt, displacing over 200 million people\n    *   Water expands in heat, leading to a higher increase in sea-level, of from 40–80 cm\n*   Floods from melting glaciers treating over 4 M km<sup>2</sup> of land\n\n\n### Case study: climate change impacts on the UK\n\n\n\n*   Temperature rise of 1.5–4.5ºC\n*   Sea-level rise by 20–40 cm (around 3 mm per year, as predicted by the government)\n*   Trees: deciduous trees would replace conifers\n*   Plants: crocuses and daffodils would only grow in the north; maize will only grow in the south\n*   Birds: Arctic species such as Snow bunting and Dotterel will face extinction; Greenshank and Dunlin under threat\n*   Flooding defences to be rebuilt in low-lying areas: Kent, East Angelica\n*   More heat waves, like those in 2003, which killed over 2000 people in the UK: they are expected to become the norm by the 2040s\n*   Vector-borne diseases: more risks from new and emerging pests and diseases\n    *   The higher temperatures extends the range of certain insects and pests\n    *   Milder, lower temperature, winters also increase the survival rate of these pests\n\n\n### Changes in sea ice\n\n\n\n*   Melting season of Arctic increase\n*   As sea ice recedes, potential for wave formation reduces\n*   Larger waves help break up sea ice, establishing positive feedback of disappearing sea ice and wave formation\n    *   In 2012, a 5-meter wave was recorded in the Beaufort Sea\n*   Methane emissions from tundra will increase because \n*   Polar bears have less time to hunt seal, and must spend more time on land\n    *   There is also a reduced body size, and decreased reproductive success\n\n\n### Glaciers and ice caps\n\n\n\n*   The Himalayan glaciers are retreating\n    *   This may have a major impact on the region’s water supply (the Hindu Kush Himalayan region; glacier treatment could water shortages for up to 1.5 B people)\n*   Combined with other factors such as population growth and high density of population, this issue is made worse\n\n\n### Case study: retreat of Swiss glaciers\n\n\n\n*   The Swiss Alps declined from 1,800 km<sup>2</sup> in 1850 to 1,300 km<sup>2</sup> in 1972, a loss of ⅓ of the surface area\n*   The glacier changed substantially between 1882 and 2015\n    *   In 1882, it was 15 km long\n    *   Between 1883 and 1885, it grew slowly, around 4 km; it remained steady for a few years\n    *   It then repeated 26 m/yr for the next couple of years\n    *   By 1920, it was retreating 10 m/yr\n    *   Annual rates increase  in the 1920s\n    *   In 2007–8, it retreated drastically, a total of 290 m\n*   It has retreated over 2.5 km over the last 130 years due to global warming\n*   Problems include\n    *   Economic: loss of homes and tourism (tourist guides and ski hotels lose tourists and hence income)\n    *   Social: less tourists arrive, tribes and displaced people must migrate\n    *   Environmental: loss of habitat and biomes as the alps receded for animals such as the Alpine ibex and Chamois\n\n\n## Changes in carbon stored in ice, oceans, and biosphere\n\n\n\n*   Before the industrial revolution, the amount of ice stored on land, in oceans, and in the biosphere was balanced, but human activity has tipped the balance\n*   Before the industrial revolution, the carbon concentration would only change through\n    *   Volcanic eruptions\n    *   Sea-floor spreading\n*   In the 1990s, human activity added 8.0 PgC, 6.4 of which acme from burning fossil fuels\n    *   The oceans absorbed 28% and the land 32%, the rest remaining in the atmosphere \n*   But in 2000–8, human activity added 9.1 PgC to the atmosphere annually, 7.7 PgC from fossil fuels and 1.4 PgC from deforestation and land -use change \n\n\n### Oceans\n\n\n\n*   More carbon increases warms the atmosphere and makes plants grow faster and store more carbon\n*   An increased carbon in the atmosphere has lead to more dissolving in the oceans\n    *   This endangers much marine life, especially shell-building animals as the acids dissolve and weaken the shells (weaken the carbonates of crabs and lobsters, and they end up with thinner shells)\n    *   The pH of water has dropped by 0.1 since 1750\n*   Warmer oceans decrease the abundance of phytoplankton, which grow more vigorously in cool, nutrient-rich waters such \n\n\n### Biosphere\n\n\n\n*   With the doubling carbon dioxide, plant growth increases by 12–76%\n*   Many forests are cleared for agricultural zones\n    *   However, if farmland is abandoned, such as in **Montserrat**, the vegetation ma revert to forest\n    *   By preventing wildfires, humans prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere, and instead it builds up in plants\n        *   Therefore, the use of fire to create new farmland releases considerable amounts of carbon into the atmosphere\n\n\n### Ice\n\n\n\n*   Permafrost contain large deposits of carbon, accumulate over thousands of years\n*   The low temperature reduces the rate of decomposition of organic plant matter, leading an accumulation of dead organic matter\n*   Warming of the peric glacier environments will lead to increased methane emissions\n*   Decreases show reduced reflectivity of the surface, increasing the absorption of solar radiation (positive feedback)\n\n\n## Changes in biomes\n\n\n\n*   Low-lying biomes such sa **mangroves** may be lost as a result of changes in sea level\n*   Climate change in the past has happened over long periods of time, allowing animals to adapt gradually to new conditions\n    *   Current increases in temperature are happening very rapidly, so there is less time for organisms to adapt\n    *   Organisms will either have to migrate or go extinct if they’re unable to adapt\n\n\n### Changes to agriculture\n\n\n\n*   Northward shift of wheat-growing in North America\n*   More difficult to irrigate fields due to limited water resources\n\n\n## Impact of climate change on people and places\n\n\n\n*   Organisms-based diseases such as malaria: new hotter conditions are better for mosquitoes to breed\n*   Migration due to changes in sea-level causes environmental-refugees\n*   Changes in tourism\n    *   Extended summers, which o=is good for coastal resorts in North America\n    *   Winter sports stopped due to lack of snow (in Aviemore, an in the Alps)\n    *   Reduced precipitation makes some locations economic due to water shortage\n\n\n### Social\n\n\n\n*   Hunger and conflict\n\n\n# Responding to climate change\n\n\n## Disparities in exposure\n\n\n\n*   **Exposure** is the degree to which people are exposed to climate change\n*   **Sensitivity** is the degree to which people could be harmed by exposure to climate change\n*   **Adaptive capacity** is the degree to which they could mitigate the potential harm by taking action to reduce their exposure or sensitivity\n*   Certain **populations** are more **vulnerable** than others: the very young, elderly, disabled, poor, minority groups, refugees, and indigenous people\n*   Certain **locations** are more **vulnerable** than others: low-lying islands, river mouths, valleys, coastal areas, regions deriving water supplies from mountain glaciers; therefore they face\n    *   Increased coastal erosion\n    *   Saline intrusion into groundwater supplies\n    *   Deterioration of coral reefs\n    *   Out-migration of people\n    *   Loss of income due to a decline in economic activities and infrastructure\n\n\n## Case study: Flooding in Bangladesh\n\n\n\n*   Most of Bangladesh lives along a delta formed by **three rivers** (**the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra**), which periodically flood the land\n    *   This is essential as it naturally irrigate the crops and increases soil fertility\n    *   However, since 1970, the scale, impact, and duration of these floods has increased, and there are still scientific prediction that it will continue increasing\n    *   A rise in temperatures of **2.6ºC** will lead to widespread repeated flooding\n    *   Due to **sea-level rise**, the densely populated coastal zone of Bangladesh is also increasingly vulnerable to coastal floods\n*   The flood damage is worsening due to the increased intensity of extreme precipitation events and the **14-40%** increase in monsoon rainfalls by the 2030s\n    *   Since 1990, the frencuney of extreme precipitation has increased in Narayanpur island as normal floods have become more catastrophic\n        *   Fewer than 1% can reach medical help within 1 hour as there is no suitable transport for those living by the indian border\n        *   People often have to sell assets post a flood to buy food and equipment\n*   Government and non-government organizations have been involved in reducing the impacts of flooding in Bangladesh\n    *   In 1988, after the most severe floodings of the 20th century, the government developed the **Flood Action Plan**\n        *   Sluice gates were built on a number of rivers, which provided protection from flooding by tidal waves and storm surges\n    *   5,700 km of embankments were also built\n    *   Neary 5,000 km of drainage channels were built\n    *   200 flood shelters on stilts for equation of people threatened by floods\n        *   Watch has brick toilets and septic tanks to reduce water contamination\n*   Impacts of the flood include\n    *   Personal security\n        *   Deaths from drowning, diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid\n        *   Loss of income\n        *   Loss or unavailability of fuelwood\n    *   Buildings and infrastructure\n        *   Tin-wall and mud houses washed away\n        *   Damage to temples, and factories\n    *   Crops and animals\n        *   Loss of livestock\n        *   Grain shortages\n        *   Damage to vegetation\n\n\n## Case study: Vulnerability and adaptation in Ghana\n\n\n\n*   In Ghana in West Africa, there are a number of adaptations include\n    *   Infrastructure development: building dams, levees, and seawalls\n    *   Ecosystem-based measures: preserving and restoring natural habitats such as mangrove swamps\n    *   Capacity development: education and to teach people new techniques and to empower people\n*   There are different impacts and adaptations in different zones\n    *   Northern Savanna\n        *   Increased morbidity and disease prevalence\n        *   Increased vulnerability of the poor\n        *   Increased out-mediation and loss of human capital\n    *   Forest\n        *   Decreased food security \n        *   Dry-ups of water bodies and underground water\n        *   Population pressure on land\n    *   Coastal Savanna\n        *   Decreased water availability and quality\n        *   Higher burden on women\n        *   Increased migration\n        *   Increased cholera\n\n\n## Government-led action\n\n\n### The UN Framework Concentration on climate change (1992)\n\n\n\n*   The objective was to prevent GHGs in the atmosphere to grow to dangerous levels\n*   It went into effect in 1994, but failed\n*   The **Kyoto Protocol (1997)** was the first major attempt to implement the treaty\n    *   HICs were required to cut carbon emissions by 20% by 2012 compared to the 1990 emissions\n    *   The US didn't sign while Canada and Australia did\n",html:"<h1>Causes of global climate change</h1>\n<h2>Structure of the

biomes as the alps receded for animals such as the Alpine ibex and Chamois</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changes in carbon stored in ice, oceans, and biosphere</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Before the industrial revolution, the amount of ice stored on land, in oceans, and in the biosphere was balanced, but human activity has tipped the balance</li>\n<li>Before the industrial revolution, the carbon concentration would only change through\n<ul>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n<li>Sea-floor spreading</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In the 1990s, human activity added 8.0 PgC, 6.4 of which acme from burning fossil fuels\n<ul>\n<li>The oceans absorbed 28% and the land 32%, the rest remaining in the atmosphere</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>But in 2000–8, human activity added 9.1 PgC to the atmosphere annually, 7.7 PgC from fossil fuels and 1.4 PgC from deforestation and land -use change</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Oceans</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>More carbon increases warms the atmosphere and makes plants grow faster and store more carbon</li>\n<li>An increased carbon in the atmosphere has lead to more dissolving in the oceans\n<ul>\n<li>This endangers much marine life, especially shell-building animals as the acids dissolve and weaken the shells (weaken the carbonates of crabs and lobsters, and they end up with thinner shells)</li>\n<li>The pH of water has dropped by 0.1 since 1750</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Warmer oceans decrease the abundance of phytoplankton, which grow more vigorously in cool, nutrient-rich waters such</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Biosphere</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>With the doubling carbon dioxide, plant growth increases by 12–76%</li>\n<li>Many forests are cleared for agricultural zones\n<ul>\n<li>However, if farmland is abandoned, such as in <strong>Montserrat</strong>, the vegetation ma revert to forest</li>\n<li>By preventing wildfires, humans prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere, and instead it builds up in plants\n<ul>\n<li>Therefore, the use of fire to create new farmland releases considerable amounts of carbon into the atmosphere</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ice</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Permafrost contain large deposits of carbon, accumulate over thousands of years</li>\n<li>The low temperature reduces the rate of decomposition of organic plant matter, leading an accumulation of dead organic matter</li>\n<li>Warming of the peric glacier environments will lead to increased methane emissions</li>\n<li>Decreases show reduced reflectivity of the surface, increasing the absorption of solar radiation (positive feedback)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changes in biomes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-lying biomes such sa <strong>mangroves</strong> may be lost as a result of changes in sea level</li>\n<li>Climate change in the past has happened over long periods of time,

}]',component:{data:{},render:{},created:{}}}}},body:{writable:!0,enumerable:!0,value:"# Causes of global climate change\n\n\n## Structure of the Earth\n\n\n\n*   Thermosphere\n*   Atmosphere\n*   Stratosphere\n*   Troposphere\n\n\n### Atmospheric energy balance\n\n\n\n*   **Insolation** is incoming solar radiation\n*   Most of this energy in the tropical regions, whereas there is a loss in energy from poles\n*   There is a redistribution of energy from lower altitudes to higher latitudes by wind circulation and ocean currents\n*   Only 46% of energy is absorbed at the surface\n\n\n### Atmospheric energy balance\n\n\n\n*   There are three types of heat transfer\n    *   Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves\n    *   Convection is the transfer of heat by movement of gas or liquid\n    *   Conduction is the transfer of heat by contact\n*   Of **46%** of the insolation reaches the earth's atmosphere\n*   Reflection from the earth's surface is known as **planetary albedo** \n*   Energy received from the Sun by the Earth is re-radiate at a long wavelength\n\n\n### Incoming (short-wave) radiation\n\n\n\n*   **Insolation** is the main energy out, and it affected by latitude, season, and cloud cover\n    *   The less cloud cover, the more radiation reaches the Earth’s surface\n*   Short-wave radiation is not absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, they only heat up the Earth, which then predicted long-wave radiation\n\n\n### Long-wave radiation\n\n\n\n*   **Long-wave radiation** refers to the radiation of energy from the Earth (cold body) into the atmosphere\n*   During the day, outgoing long-wave radiation transfer is greater than the incoming long-wave transfer, so there is a net loss of energy\n*   On a cloudy night, clouds return some long-wave radiation to the surface, which reduced the overall loss of energy\n\n\n## The greenhouse effect\n\n\n\n*   The **greenhouse effect** is the process by which certain gases allow short-wave radiation from the Sun to pass through the atmosphere but trap an increasing proportion of outgoing long-wave radiation from the Earth\n\n\n### Greenhouse gases\n\n\n\n*   Water vapour: accounts for 50% of the greenhouse effect\n*   Carbon dioxide: from deforestation, as it removed tres that convert carbon dioxide to oxygen\n*   Methane: from cattle, wetlands\n*   Chlorofluorocarbons: destroy ozone\n\n\n## Changes in the global energy balance\n\n\n### Variations in solar radiation\n\n\n\n*   Changes in the output of energy from the sun (11-year cycle)\n*   Small variations in the Earth's orbit affect the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation (responsible for ice ages)\n*   Changes in atmospheric composition are linked to an increase in global temperature\n*   Changes in **albedo**, as the ice melts and is replaced by darker vegetation\n\n\n### Global dimming\n\n\n\n*   Air pollution has a cooling effect\n*   Natural particles in clean air provide condensation nuclei for water, and polluted air contains more particles than clean air, and therefore many more states for water to bind to\n*   The droplets are smaller than natural ones, meaning polluted clouds conant smaller water droplets, and hence reflect more sunlight, presenting the Sun’s heat from getting through the Earth's surface\n\n\n### Feedback loops\n\n\n\n1. Positive feedback\n    *   Ice caps\n        *   Melting of polar ice caps = lower albedo\n        *   Less ice = less reflection of radiation\n        *   So more energy absorbed, hence an increase in temperature\n    *   Melting ice and water\n        *   Melt Ice ice = more water = bigger waves\n        *   Larger waves break up sea ice\n        *   Water is less reflective, so more energy absorbed, hence an increase in temperature\n    *   Permafrost\n        *   Thawing of permafrost = increase in methane levels\n        *   Adding to the GHGs\n        *   So increase in temperature because heat is prevented from leaving\n2. Negative feedback\n    *   Burning, leading to more aerosols, and reduced solar radiation, causing cooling (global dimming)\n    *   Increased evaporation, leading to more cooling\n\nCase study: negative feedback in Greenland\n\n\n## Enhanced greenhouse effect\n\n\n\n*   The **enhanced greenhouse effect** is the impact of increasing levels of greenhouse gases as a result of human activities, often referred to as **global warming**\n*   The increase in the world's greenhouse gases is linked to industrialization, trade, and globalization\n\n\n# Consequences of global climate change\n\n\n## Implications\n\n\n\n*   Sea-level rise: floods to low-lying areas such as the Maldives, and Bangladesh\n*   Storm activity increase\n*   Agricultural patterns change: USA’s grain belt will shrink and production will decline, while Canada's goriing season will get longer and more productive\n*   Less rainfall over the USA, southern Europe, and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\n*   Up to **40%** of wildlife species will go extinct in the Amazon, Miombo woodlands of South Africa (African elephants, sundarban tigers, and also sea-animals such as sharks)\n\n\n### Hydrosphere\n\n\n\n*   Rise in sea-levels flooding low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, Netherlands, Egypt, displacing over 200 million people\n    *   Water expands in heat, leading to a higher increase in sea-level, of from 40–80 cm\n*   Floods from melting glaciers treating over 4 M km<sup>2</sup> of land\n\n\n### Case study: climate change impacts on the UK\n\n\n\n*   Temperature rise of 1.5–4.5ºC\n*   Sea-level rise by 20–40 cm (around 3 mm per year, as predicted by the government)\n*   Trees: deciduous trees would replace conifers\n*   Plants: crocuses and daffodils would only grow in the north; maize will only grow in the south\n*   Birds: Arctic species such as Snow bunting and Dotterel will face extinction; Greenshank and Dunlin under threat\n*   Flooding defences to be rebuilt in low-lying areas: Kent, East Angelica\n*   More heat waves, like those in 2003, which killed over 2000 people in the UK: they are expected to become the norm by the 2040s\n*   Vector-borne diseases: more risks from new and emerging pests and diseases\n    *   The higher temperatures extends the range of certain insects and pests\n    *   Milder, lower temperature, winters also increase the survival rate of these pests\n\n\n### Changes in sea ice\n\n\n\n*   Melting season of Arctic increase\n*   As sea ice recedes, potential for wave formation reduces\n*   Larger waves help break up sea ice, establishing positive feedback of disappearing sea ice and wave formation\n    *   In 2012, a 5-meter wave was recorded in the Beaufort Sea\n*   Methane emissions from tundra will increase because \n*   Polar bears have less time to hunt seal, and must spend more time on land\n    *   There is also a reduced body size, and decreased reproductive success\n\n\n### Glaciers and ice caps\n\n\n\n*   The Himalayan glaciers are retreating\n    *   This may have a major impact on the region’s water supply (the Hindu Kush Himalayan region; glacier treatment could water shortages for up to 1.5 B people)\n*   Combined with other factors such as population growth and high density of population, this issue is made worse\n\n\n### Case study: retreat of Swiss glaciers\n\n\n\n*   The Swiss Alps declined from 1,800 km<sup>2</sup> in 1850 to 1,300 km<sup>2</sup> in 1972, a loss of ⅓ of the surface area\n*   The glacier changed substantially between 1882 and 2015\n    *   In 1882, it was 15 km long\n    *   Between 1883 and 1885, it grew slowly, around 4 km; it remained steady for a few years\n    *   It then repeated 26 m/yr for the next couple of years\n    *   By 1920, it was retreating 10 m/yr\n    *   Annual rates increase  in the 1920s\n    *   In 2007–8, it retreated drastically, a total of 290 m\n*   It has retreated over 2.5 km over the last 130 years due to global warming\n*   Problems include\n    *   Economic: loss of homes and tourism (tourist guides and ski hotels lose tourists and hence income)\n    *   Social: less tourists arrive, tribes and displaced people must migrate\n    *   Environmental: loss of habitat and biomes as the alps receded for animals such as the Alpine ibex and Chamois\n\n\n## Changes in carbon stored in ice, oceans, and biosphere\n\n\n\n*   Before the industrial revolution, the amount of ice stored on land, in oceans, and in the biosphere was balanced, but human activity has tipped the balance\n*   Before the industrial revolution, the carbon concentration would only change through\n    *   Volcanic eruptions\n    *   Sea-floor spreading\n*   In the 1990s, human activity added 8.0 PgC, 6.4 of which acme from burning fossil fuels\n    *   The oceans absorbed 28% and the land 32%, the rest remaining in the atmosphere \n*   But in 2000–8, human activity added 9.1 PgC to the atmosphere annually, 7.7 PgC from fossil fuels and 1.4 PgC from deforestation and land -use change \n\n\n### Oceans\n\n\n\n*   More carbon increases warms the atmosphere and makes plants grow faster and store more carbon\n*   An increased carbon in the atmosphere has lead to more dissolving in the oceans\n    *   This endangers much marine life, especially shell-building animals as the acids dissolve and weaken the shells (weaken the carbonates of crabs and lobsters, and they end up with thinner shells)\n    *   The pH of water has dropped by 0.1 since 1750\n*   Warmer oceans decrease the abundance of phytoplankton, which grow more vigorously in cool, nutrient-rich waters such \n\n\n### Biosphere\n\n\n\n*   With the doubling carbon dioxide, plant growth increases by 12–76%\n*   Many forests are cleared for agricultural zones\n    *   However, if farmland is abandoned, such as in **Montserrat**, the vegetation ma revert to forest\n    *   By preventing wildfires, humans prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere, and instead it builds up in plants\n        *   Therefore, the use of fire to create new farmland releases considerable amounts of carbon into the atmosphere\n\n\n### Ice\n\n\n\n*   Permafrost contain large deposits of carbon, accumulate over thousands of years\n*   The low temperature reduces the rate of decomposition of organic plant matter, leading an accumulation of dead organic matter\n*   Warming of the peric glacier environments will lead to increased methane emissions\n*   Decreases show reduced reflectivity of the surface, increasing the absorption of solar radiation (positive feedback)\n\n\n## Changes in biomes\n\n\n\n*   Low-lying biomes such sa **mangroves** may be lost as a result of changes in sea level\n*   Climate change in the past has happened over long periods of time, allowing animals to adapt gradually to new conditions\n    *   Current increases in temperature are happening very rapidly, so there is less time for organisms to adapt\n    *   Organisms will either have to migrate or go extinct if they’re unable to adapt\n\n\n### Changes to agriculture\n\n\n\n*   Northward shift of wheat-growing in North America\n*   More difficult to irrigate fields due to limited water resources\n\n\n## Impact of climate change on people and places\n\n\n\n*   Organisms-based diseases such as malaria: new hotter conditions are better for mosquitoes to breed\n*   Migration due to changes in sea-level causes environmental-refugees\n*   Changes in tourism\n    *   Extended summers, which o=is good for coastal resorts in North America\n    *   Winter sports stopped due to lack of snow (in Aviemore, an in the Alps)\n    *   Reduced precipitation makes some locations economic due to water shortage\n\n\n### Social\n\n\n\n*   Hunger and conflict\n\n\n# Responding to climate change\n\n\n## Disparities in exposure\n\n\n\n*   **Exposure** is the degree to which people are exposed to climate change\n*   **Sensitivity** is the degree to which people could be harmed by exposure to climate change\n*   **Adaptive capacity** is the degree to which they could mitigate the potential harm by taking action to reduce their exposure or sensitivity\n*   Certain **populations** are more **vulnerable** than others: the very young, elderly, disabled, poor, minority groups, refugees, and indigenous people\n*   Certain **locations** are more **vulnerable** than others: low-lying islands, river mouths, valleys, coastal areas, regions deriving water supplies from mountain glaciers; therefore they face\n    *   Increased coastal erosion\n    *   Saline intrusion into groundwater supplies\n    *   Deterioration of coral reefs\n    *   Out-migration of people\n    *   Loss of income due to a decline in economic activities and infrastructure\n\n\n## Case study: Flooding in Bangladesh\n\n\n\n*   Most of Bangladesh lives along a delta formed by **three rivers** (**the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra**), which periodically flood the land\n    *   This is essential as it naturally irrigate the crops and increases soil fertility\n    *   However, since 1970, the scale, impact, and duration of these floods has increased, and there are still scientific prediction that it will continue increasing\n    *   A rise in temperatures of **2.6ºC** will lead to widespread repeated flooding\n    *   Due to **sea-level rise**, the densely populated coastal zone of Bangladesh is also increasingly vulnerable to coastal floods\n*   The flood damage is worsening due to the increased intensity of extreme precipitation events and the **14-40%** increase in monsoon rainfalls by the 2030s\n    *   Since 1990, the frencuney of extreme precipitation has increased in Narayanpur island as normal floods have become more catastrophic\n        *   Fewer than 1% can reach medical help within 1 hour as there is no suitable transport for those living by the indian border\n        *   People often have to sell assets post a flood to buy food and equipment\n*   Government and non-government organizations have been involved in reducing the impacts of flooding in Bangladesh\n    *   In 1988, after the most severe floodings of the 20th century, the government developed the **Flood Action Plan**\n        *   Sluice gates were built on a number of rivers, which provided protection from flooding by tidal waves and storm surges\n    *   5,700 km of embankments

albedo</strong></li>\n<li>Energy received from the Sun by the Earth is re-radiate at a long wavelength</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Incoming (short-wave) radiation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insolation</strong> is the main energy out, and it affected by latitude, season, and cloud cover\n<ul>\n<li>The less cloud cover, the more radiation reaches the Earth’s surface</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Short-wave radiation is not absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, they only heat up the Earth, which then predicted long-wave radiation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Long-wave radiation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Long-wave radiation</strong> refers to the radiation of energy from the Earth (cold body) into the atmosphere</li>\n<li>During the day, outgoing long-wave radiation transfer is greater than the incoming long-wave transfer, so there is a net loss of energy</li>\n<li>On a cloudy night, clouds return some long-wave radiation to the surface, which reduced the overall loss of energy</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The greenhouse effect</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>greenhouse effect</strong> is the process by which certain gases allow short-wave radiation from the Sun to pass through the atmosphere but trap an increasing proportion of outgoing long-wave radiation from the Earth</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Greenhouse gases</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Water vapour: accounts for 50% of the greenhouse effect</li>\n<li>Carbon dioxide: from deforestation, as it removed tres that convert carbon dioxide to oxygen</li>\n<li>Methane: from cattle, wetlands</li>\n<li>Chlorofluorocarbons: destroy ozone</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changes in the global energy balance</h2>\n<h3>Variations in solar radiation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Changes in the output of energy from the sun (11-year cycle)</li>\n<li>Small variations in the Earth's orbit affect the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation (responsible for ice ages)</li>\n<li>Changes in atmospheric composition are linked to an increase in global temperature</li>\n<li>Changes in <strong>albedo</strong>, as the ice melts and is replaced by darker vegetation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Global dimming</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Air pollution has a cooling effect</li>\n<li>Natural particles in clean air provide condensation nuclei for water, and polluted air contains more particles than clean air, and therefore many more states for water to bind to</li>\n<li>The droplets are smaller than natural ones, meaning polluted clouds conant smaller water droplets, and hence reflect more sunlight, presenting the Sun’s heat from getting through the Earth's surface</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feedback loops</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Positive feedback\n<ul>\n<li>Ice caps\n<ul>\n<li>Melting of polar ice caps = lower albedo</li>\n<li>Less ice = less reflection of radiation</li>\n<li>So more energy absorbed,

radiation, causing cooling (global dimming)</li>\n<li>Increased evaporation, leading to more cooling</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Case study: negative feedback in Greenland</p>\n<h2>Enhanced greenhouse effect</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>enhanced greenhouse effect</strong> is the impact of increasing levels of greenhouse gases as a result of human activities, often referred to as <strong>global warming</strong></li>\n<li>The increase in the world's greenhouse gases is linked to industrialization, trade, and globalization</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Consequences of global climate change</h1>\n<h2>Implications</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Sea-level rise: floods to low-lying areas such as the Maldives, and Bangladesh</li>\n<li>Storm activity increase</li>\n<li>Agricultural patterns change: USA’s grain belt will shrink and production will decline, while Canada's goriing season will get longer and more productive</li>\n<li>Less rainfall over the USA, southern Europe, and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)</li>\n<li>Up to <strong>40%</strong> of wildlife species will go extinct in the Amazon, Miombo woodlands of South Africa (African elephants, sundarban tigers, and also sea-animals such as sharks)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Hydrosphere</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rise in sea-levels flooding low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, Netherlands, Egypt, displacing over 200 million people\n<ul>\n<li>Water expands in heat, leading to a higher increase in sea-level, of from 40–80 cm</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Floods from melting glaciers treating over 4 M km<sup>2</sup> of land</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Case study: climate change impacts on the UK</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Temperature rise of 1.5–4.5ºC</li>\n<li>Sea-level rise by 20–40 cm (around 3 mm per year, as predicted by the government)</li>\n<li>Trees: deciduous trees would replace conifers</li>\n<li>Plants: crocuses and daffodils would only grow in the north; maize will only grow in the south</li>\n<li>Birds: Arctic species such as Snow bunting and Dotterel will face extinction; Greenshank and Dunlin under threat</li>\n<li>Flooding defences to be rebuilt in low-lying areas: Kent, East Angelica</li>\n<li>More heat waves, like those in 2003, which killed over 2000 people in the UK: they are expected to become the norm by the 2040s</li>\n<li>Vector-borne diseases: more risks from new and emerging pests and diseases\n<ul>\n<li>The higher temperatures extends the range of certain insects and pests</li>\n<li>Milder, lower temperature, winters also increase the survival rate of these pests</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes in sea ice</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Melting season of Arctic increase</li>\n<li>As sea ice recedes, potential for wave formation reduces</li>\n<li>Larger waves help break up sea ice, establishing positive feedback of disappearing sea ice and wave formation\n<ul>\n<li>In 2012, a 5-meter wave was recorded in the Beaufort Sea</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Methane emissions from tundra will increase because</li>\n<li>Polar bears have less time to hunt seal, and must spend more time on land\n<ul>\n<li>There is also a reduced body size, and decreased reproductive success</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Glaciers and ice caps</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Himalayan glaciers are retreating\n<ul>\n<li>This may have a major impact on the region’s water supply (the Hindu Kush Himalayan region; glacier treatment could water shortages for up to 1.5 B people)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Combined with other factors such as population growth and high density of population, this issue is made worse</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Case study: retreat of Swiss glaciers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Swiss Alps declined from 1,800 km<sup>2</sup> in 1850 to 1,300 km<sup>2</sup> in 1972, a loss of ⅓ of the surface area</li>\n<li>The glacier changed substantially between 1882 and 2015\n<ul>\n<li>In 1882, it was 15 km long</li>\n<li>Between 1883 and 1885, it grew slowly, around 4 km; it remained steady for a few years</li>\n<li>It then repeated 26 m/yr for the next couple of years</li>\n<li>By 1920, it was retreating 10 m/yr</li>\n<li>Annual rates increase  in the 1920s</li>\n<li>In 2007–8, it retreated drastically, a total of 290 m</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It has retreated over 2.5 km over the last 130 years due to global warming</li>\n<li>Problems include\n<ul>\n<li>Economic: loss of homes and tourism (tourist guides and ski hotels lose tourists and hence income)</li>\n<li>Social: less tourists arrive, tribes and displaced people must migrate</li>\n<li>Environmental: loss of habitat and biomes as the alps receded for animals such as the Alpine ibex and Chamois</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changes in carbon stored in ice, oceans, and biosphere</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Before the industrial revolution, the amount of ice stored on land, in oceans, and in the biosphere was balanced, but human activity has tipped the balance</li>\n<li>Before the industrial revolution, the carbon concentration would only change through\n<ul>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n<li>Sea-floor spreading</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In the 1990s, human activity added 8.0 PgC, 6.4 of which acme from burning fossil fuels\n<ul>\n<li>The oceans absorbed 28% and the land 32%, the rest remaining in the atmosphere</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>But in 2000–8, human activity added 9.1 PgC to the atmosphere annually, 7.7 PgC from fossil fuels and 1.4 PgC from deforestation and land -use change</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Oceans</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>More carbon increases warms the atmosphere and makes plants grow faster and store more carbon</li>\n<li>An increased carbon in the atmosphere has lead to more dissolving in the oceans\n<ul>\n<li>This endangers much marine life, especially shell-building animals as the acids dissolve and weaken the shells (weaken the carbonates of crabs and lobsters, and they end up with thinner shells)</li>\n<li>The pH of water has dropped by 0.1 since 1750</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Warmer oceans decrease the abundance of phytoplankton, which grow more vigorously in cool, nutrient-rich waters such</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Biosphere</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>With the doubling carbon dioxide, plant growth increases by 12–76%</li>\n<li>Many forests are cleared for agricultural zones\n<ul>\n<li>However, if farmland is abandoned, such as in <strong>Montserrat</strong>, the vegetation ma revert to forest</li>\n<li>By preventing wildfires, humans prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere, and instead it builds up in plants\n<ul>\n<li>Therefore, the use of fire to create new farmland releases considerable amounts of carbon into the atmosphere</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ice</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Permafrost contain large deposits of carbon, accumulate over thousands of years</li>\n<li>The low temperature reduces the rate of decomposition of organic plant matter, leading an accumulation of dead organic matter</li>\n<li>Warming of the peric glacier environments will lead to increased methane emissions</li>\n<li>Decreases show reduced reflectivity of the surface, increasing the absorption of solar radiation (positive feedback)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changes in biomes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-lying biomes such sa <strong>mangroves</strong> may be lost as a result of changes in sea level</li>\n<li>Climate change in the past has happened over long periods of time, allowing animals to adapt gradually to new conditions\n<ul>\n<li>Current increases in temperature are happening very rapidly, so there is less time for organisms to adapt</li>\n<li>Organisms will either have to migrate or go extinct if they’re unable to adapt</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes to agriculture</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Northward shift of wheat-growing in North America</li>\n<li>More difficult to irrigate fields due to limited water resources</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Impact of climate change on people and places</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Organisms-based diseases such as malaria: new hotter conditions are better for mosquitoes to breed</li>\n<li>Migration due to changes in sea-level causes environmental-refugees</li>\n<li>Changes in tourism\n<ul>\n<li>Extended summers, which o=is good for coastal resorts in North America</li>\n<li>Winter sports stopped due to lack of snow (in Aviemore, an in the Alps)</li>\n<li>Reduced precipitation makes some locations economic due to water shortage</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Social</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hunger and conflict</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Responding to climate change</h1>\n<h2>Disparities in exposure</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exposure</strong> is the degree to which people are exposed to climate change</li>\n<li><strong>Sensitivity</strong> is the degree to which people could be harmed by exposure to climate change</li>\n<li><strong>Adaptive capacity</strong> is the degree to which they could mitigate the potential harm by taking action to reduce their exposure or sensitivity</li>\n<li>Certain <strong>populations</strong> are more <strong>vulnerable</strong> than others: the very young, elderly, disabled, poor, minority groups, refugees, and indigenous people</li>\n<li>Certain <strong>locations</strong> are more <strong>vulnerable</strong> than others: low-lying islands, river mouths, valleys, coastal areas, regions deriving water supplies from mountain glaciers; therefore they face\n<ul>\n<li>Increased coastal erosion</li>\n<li>Saline intrusion into groundwater supplies</li>\n<li>Deterioration of coral reefs</li>\n<li>Out-migration of people</li>\n<li>Loss of income due to a decline in economic activities and infrastructure</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Case study: Flooding in Bangladesh</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Most of Bangladesh lives along a delta formed by <strong>three rivers</strong> (<strong>the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra</strong>), which periodically flood the land\n<ul>\n<li>This is essential as it naturally irrigate the crops and increases soil fertility</li>\n<li>However, since 1970, the scale, impact, and duration of these floods has increased, and there are still scientific prediction that it will continue increasing</li>\n<li>A rise in temperatures of <strong>2.6ºC</strong> will lead to widespread repeated flooding</li>\n<li>Due to <strong>sea-level rise</strong>, the densely populated coastal zone of Bangladesh is also increasingly vulnerable to coastal floods</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The flood damage is worsening due to the increased intensity of extreme precipitation events and the <strong>14-40%</strong> increase in monsoon rainfalls by the 2030s\n<ul>\n<li>Since 1990, the frencuney of extreme precipitation has increased in Narayanpur island as normal floods have become more catastrophic\n<ul>\n<li>Fewer than 1% can reach medical help within 1 hour as there is no suitable transport for those living by the indian border</li>\n<li>People often have to sell assets post a flood to buy food and equipment</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Government and non-government organizations have been involved in reducing the impacts of flooding in Bangladesh\n<ul>\n<li>In 1988, after the most severe floodings of the 20th century, the government developed the <strong>Flood Action Plan</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Sluice gates were built on a number of rivers, which provided

class\n\n\n\n*   Poverty reduction was a goal of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) between **2000 and 2015**, and was a success:\n    *   1990: 50% of people in LICs lived on less than $1.25\n    *   2015: only 14%\n    *   The number of people living in extreme poverty fell from 1.9 B in 1990 to 836 M in 2015\n*   At the same time, the number of people in the middle class tripled between **1990 and 2015** (people living on at leat $4/day)\n    *   This is because of the increase in average incomes and the fall in the number of people living in absolute poverty\n    *   Thi is a good economic feature as it helps increase the sales of goods such as phones, cars, electronic goods: the sales of cars increased by over **800%** since 2009\n    *   However, in the 1980s Brazil the middle class accounted for less than 30% of the population since the 1960s, unlike South Korea, where the middle class accounted for 50%\n*   Hover, not all the middle class has **economic security** as many people on incomes of over $4/day remain vulnerable to un(der)employment\n    *   **800 M people** still live in extreme poverty including workers, living in unsafe conditions\n    *   People are also disadvantages on accounts of race and gender: in Latin America, women are more likely to live in poverty than men\n        *   The proportion has increased from 108 women to 100 men in 1997 to 117 women to 100 men in 2012\n    *   Globally, **75%** of men are part of global labor force, but only **50%** of women are, and women earn on average **25%** less than men\n\n\n## Global consumption of resources\n\n\n### Ecological footprints\n\n\n\n*   An **ecological footprint** is the hypothetical area of land required by a society, group, or individual to fulfill all their resource needs and assimilate their wastes\n*   A country **increases** the ecological footprint through\n    *   Relying on fossil fuels\n    *   Higher levels of imported resources (higher transport)\n    *   Meat-rich diets\n    *   High technology and energy use\n    *   Large population\n*   A country **reduces** the ecological footprint through\n    *   Reducing the amount of resources used\n    *   Recycling and reusing\n    *   Improving resource use and efficiency\n    *   Improve technology to increase carrying capacity\n    *   Technology to improve and increase land use\n    *   Reducing population (anti-natalist policies)\n\n\n### Ecological footprints in HICs and LICs\n\n\n\n*   HICs, in general, have higher disposable incomes which means that consumption and demand for energy resources are high, and their resource use is more wasteful\n    *   Meat-eating diets are more prevalent in HICs, where **30%** of the diet is based off of animal protein\n        *   Meat-eating diets in general use more land than the vegetarian diet as animals use **90%** of the for they eat for other processes such as respiration\n*   People in LICs, by contrast, have less to spend\n    *   Resources are often recycled through the informal economy\n*   GHG emissions from agriculture also affect the total footprint\n    *   According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the agriculture sector emist between 5.1 and 6.1 B tonnes of GHG annually, about **11%** of the total GHG emissions\n*   Populations more **dependent on fossil fuels** have higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions\n\n\n## Patterns and trends in water availability and consumption\n\n\n\n*   **Embedded/virtual water** refers to the way in which water is transferred from one country to another through its exports\n*   Water is unevenly distributed: about **780 M** people do not have access to clean water, and this number will increase in 2015, when the world population will likely reach around **9 B**\n*   HICs maintain or increase their consumption of resources such as water, although an increasing portion of this water is embedded in agricultural and manufactured products\n*   Land grabs and transfer lead to loss of water\n    *   **Saudi Arabia** cut production of cerails at home by **12%**, and with a series of land grabs, produced the cereals it needed in parts of Africa\n*   Various trends **increase** the pressure on water\n    *   Population growth, expected to reach **9 B **by **2050**\n    *   Growing middle class: increasing affluence leads to greater water consumption (showers, baths, gardening)\n    *   Growth of **tourism** and recreation (golf courses, water parks, pools)\n    *   Urbanization: urban areas require significant water investment to get water to people and to remove waste products hygienically\n    *   Climate change\n\n\n## Patterns and trends in the availability of land and food consumption\n\n\n\n*   The food intake has

tension or compression suddenly\n    *   The **epicenter** is the point on the surface of the earth immediately above the **focus** of the earthquake\n*   There are **shallow-deep earthquakes** (occur close to ground surface) and **deep-focus earthquakes** (occur at considerable depth)\n*   A large earthquake can be preceded by smaller tremors known as **foreshocks** and followed by numerous

plates, this increases stress on rocks, the rocks deform and eventually snap\n*   The snapping releases energy (earthquake)\n\n\n### Human triggers\n\n\n\n*   Some earthquakes occur a long way from any plate boundary as a result of human activity\n*   In **Denver, Colorado, 1960**, waste water contaminated by chemical warfare agents were injected into underlying rocks\n    *   From 1962–5, over 700 minor earthquakes were reported although no real damage was caused\n    *   The injection of this water lubricated and reactivated underground faults which had been inactive\n*   Fracking involves injecting water into rocks at high pressures, and has been associated with triggering earthquakes in the UK – in 2011, it led to a 2.3 in Lancashire\n*   The weight of water behind large reservoirs also created earthquake, such as in 1935, the Colorado river was dammed by the Hoover dam to create Lake Mead\n    *   The underlying rocks had an increased load, causing 6,000 earthquake in the next 10 years, although none caused damage\n\n\n### Resultant hazards of earthquakes\n\n<div class="responsive-table">\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Primary\n   </td>\n   <td>Secondary\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n

not accompanied by a moving agent such as a river, glaciers, or ocean waves, including\n    *   Soil creep (slow)\n    *   Avalanches (very fast)\n    *   Rockfalls (dry)\n    *   Mudflows (fluid)\n*   The processes affecting magnitude, frequency, and scale of mass movements are\n    *   Type of movement: flows, slides, slumps\n    *   Speed of movement\n    *   Water content\n    *   Material\n    *   Slope/gravity \n\n\n### Causes of mass movements\n\n\n\n*   Shear strength: a reduction in internal resistance of the slope\n*   Shear stress: increase in forces attempting to pull a mass downslope\n\nTable: Increasing and decreasing resistance\n\nCase study: Neap landslide, 2015\n\n\n\n*   Factors that trigger landslides include\n    *   Seasonal rainfall\n    *   Road construction\n    *   Slopes weakened by previous slides\n*   These factors contributed to the landslides during the Gorkha earthquake of April 2015\n*   One of the largest was an ice and rock landslide at Langtang\n*   The vertical distance was 700–800 m and the horizontal distance was 2–3 km\n\n\n# D.2 Geophysical hazard risks\n\n\n## Spatial distribution of geophysical hazard events\n\n\n### Earthquakes\n\n\n\n*   There are clearly defined linear patterns\n    *   Linear chain follow plate boundaries,\n    *   the center of the Atlantic Ocean\n    *   around the Pacific Ocean: the Ring of Fire\n*   Broad belts of earthquakes are associated with subduction zones, whereas narrow belts of earthquakes are associated with constructive plate margins (new material is forming, plates move apart)\n*   Collision boundaries, such as the Himalayas, are associated with broad belts of earthquakes; conservative plate boundaries, such as California\'s SA fault line, give a relatively narrow belt of earthquakes\n\n\n### Volcanoes\n\n\n\n*   Most are found at plate boundaries, although there are some exceptions\n    *   These include Hawaii, which occur over hotspots\n    *   A **hotspot** or **mantle plume** (a jet of hot material rising from the deep within a mantle) is responsible for the volcanoes\n    *   Hotspots play a role in the formation of new land\n*   Around ¾ of the Earth’s 550 historically active volcanoes lie along the Pacific Ring of Fire \n    *   It also includes many of the world’s most recent volcanoes such as Mt Pinatubo (Philippines), Mt Unzen (Japan), Mt Agung (Java)\n    *   Caused by the subduction beneath either oceanic or continental crust\n    *   Subduction in the oceans provides chains of volcanic islands known island arcs, such as the **Aleutian islands** formed by the Pacific subducting beneath the North American Plate\n    *   The subduction of an oceanic crust occur beneath the continental crust, and young fold mountains are formed, such as **The Andes**, which have been formed where the Nazca subducts beneath the South American plate.\n*   Other area of active vulcanicity include Iceland, Montserrat in the Caribbean\n*   Some submarine volcanoes such as Kick ‘em Jenny off Grenda in the Caribbean are monitored \n*   Although deeper levels of the Earth are much hotter than the surface, rocks are not molten as the pressure is too high\n    *   There is molten rock along the plate boundaries, which feeds the volcanoes\n\n\n### Landslides\n\n\n\n*   Naturally occurring phenomena in every environment including the tropics, temperature readings, high latitudes, and the ocean\n*   Fatal landslides tend to be more common in areas that have\n    *   Active tectonic processes that lead to high rates of uplift and occasional seismic events\n    *   High levels of precipitation, including high annual totals and high short-term intestines\n    *   A high population density\n*   The most fatal landslides occur in Ncis where the migration schemes are less likely in place\n    *   Southern edge of Himalayan edge\n    *   Central China\n    *   South-west India\n    *   Central Indonesia, the island of Java\n    *   The caribbean and central Mexico\n    *   Western edge of South America, especially Columbia\n\n\n## The relevance of hazard magnitude and frequency/recurrence intervals for risk management \n\n\n\n*   The **recurrence interval**/**return period** is the expected frequency in years for an event of aprtoucialr size\n    *   In general, small events have a high frequency/short return period, whereas large events have a very low frequency/high return period\n    *   There are fewer highly destructive earthquakes, but many minor ones\n    *   Low-frequency and high-magnitude events cause the most destruction and require the greatest management\n    *   People are able to **adapt** and become less vulnerable to high-frequency disasters such as smaller earthquakes\n\n\n### Earthquake frequency and magnitude\n\n\n\n*   Instead of the Richter scale, scientists are increasingly using the **Movement MAgnitude Scale (M)** which measure the amount of energy released\n\n\n### Measuring volcanoes\n\n\n\n*   Measured by the **Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)**, based on the amount of material ejected in the explosion, the height of the cloud created, and the amount of damage caused\n\n\n## Geophysical hazard risk as a product of economic, social, demographic, and political factors\n\nIn general, LICs are more vulnerable than industrialized countries due to the following reasons\n\nWhy do people live in hazard-prone places?\n\n\n\n*   **Behavioural school**: environmental hazards are the result of natural hazards, and people put themselves at risk by living on or at the foot of steep slopes\n*   **Structuralist school**: constraints places on poor people by prevailing social and political system of the country; poor people live in unsafe conditions, such as the slope of a hill because they are prevented from living in better areas\n*   The concept of **vulnerability** includes not only the physical effects of a natural hazard, but also the status of people and property in the affected area\n\n\n### Economic factors\n\n\n\n*   **Levels of wealth and development**: in 1976, Guatemala, 20,000 people were killed by low-quality housing in ravines and gorges; this earthquake had a markedly class impact\n*   **Construction styles and building codes**: In Sichuan 2008, following the 7.9 earthquake, government buildings remained standing while many schools were destroyed, suggesting that they were poorly build\n*   **Access to technology**: in Japan, earthquake and tsunami warnings are issued to people via smartphones; people with greater access to communications are able to keep up to date with warnings and forecast \n*   **Insurance cover**: the poor have no insurance, and are most likely to be affected in natural hazards as their housing quality is poor\n\n\n###### Social factors\n\n\n\n*   **Education**: gives people higher income, better housing, greater understanding of nature and hazard events\n*   **Public education**: programs in Japan have helped reduce the number of deaths\n*   **Awareness of hazards**\n*   **Gender**: women are often carers, and are unable to leave an area even if they want to\n\n\n### Demographic factors\n\n\n\n*   **Population density**: large urban areas, such as **Port-au-Prince** in Haiti are vulnerable to natural hazards\n*   **Age**: 65% of deaths in Japan tsunami 2011 where aged over 60\n*   **Migrants**: migrants may be unaware of some natural hazards present in an environment\n*   **Disability**: mortality rate of disabled in Japan tsunami 2011 was twice that or normal population\n*   **Cultural factors**: extend of train in governments, more\n\n\n### Political factors\n\n\n\n*   **Nature of the society**: the failure of the Burmese government increased the number of deaths from disease and malnutrition in the cyclone Nargis in 2008\n*   **Effectiveness of lines of communication**: the Sichuan earthquake of 2008 got a swift response and mobilized 100,000 troops\n*   **Availability and readiness of emergency personnel**: fewer deaths from Mt Pinatubo eruption as the USGS had minitoed the volcano closely\n\n\n## Geographical factors affecting the impacts of geophysical events\n\n\n\n*   **Magnitude and frequency of events**: shallow-focus earthquakes are potentially more damaging that deep-focus earthquakes (overlying rocks absorb most of the energy)\n*   **Population density**: a geophysical hazard hitting an urban area could inflict more damage to an urbanized area such as Tokyo\n    *   The 1985 8.0 Mexico city earthquake occurred in the city and killed around 5,000 people\n*   **Type of buildings**: HICs have better earthquake-resistant buildings, and people are more likely to have insurance cover than in LICs \n*   **Time of the day**: earthquakes at busy times such as peak hours cause more deaths (this is less of a factor for volcanoes as they do not have a sudden onset)\n    *   The Sichuan 2008 earthquake 7,9 occurred at 14:00 pm, and ended up killing many school children too\n*   **Types of rocks and sediments**: liquefaction occurs when loose material is shaken, so buildings built on solid rock are much safer\n    *   The Casita volcano in Nicaragua caused landslides due to the unconsolidated volcanic sediments\n*   **Secondary hazards**: these can often cause more fatalities than the original event (tsunamis, fires, contaminated water, disease, hunger, hypothermia)\n    *   More people died due to lahars following the Pinatubo 1991 eruption than the volcanic eruption\n*   **Economic development**: HICs generally have a better level of preparedness and emergency response\n\nSee research skills\n\n\n# Hazard risk and vulnerability\n\n\n## Vulnerability\n\n\n\n*   **Vulnerability** are the characteristics and circumstances of a community, system, or asset that make it susceptible to damaging effects of a hazard\n*   It is related to many factors:\n    *   **Physical factors**: poor design, construction, unregulated land use\n    *   **Social factors**: poverty and inequality – these groups are more vulnerable\n    *   **Economic factors**: those in the uninsured, informal sector, workers facing economic pressures are more vulnerable\n    *   **Environmental factors**: poor environmental management, overconsumption of natural resources\n*   Vulnerability explains how non-extreme hazards can lead to extreme impacts (due to factors above)\n\n\n## Risk\n\n\n\n*   **Risk** is the likelihood of loss of life, injury, or destruction and damage from a disaster in a given period of time\n*   Disaster risk = consequence of the interaction between **hazards** and characteristics that make people **vulnerable** and **exposed**\n*   Managing risks is shared across a wide range of sectors:\n    *   Insurance sector: recovery from disaster losses\n    *   Construction sector: so that buildings are built according to disaster codes\n    *   Land-use and urban planning sectors: locations of new developments takes into account the likelihood of a hazard event\n\n\n## Earthquake (CS)\n\n[CS = case study]\n\n[Never completed this, but you should]\n\n## Volcanic

hazard disaster trends and future predictions\n\n\n\n*   Geophysical hazard frequency between 1994 and 2013 has remained relatively constant, while population growth and economic development has varied considerably and increased\n*   LICs bear a disproportionate burden to national disasters, including disparities in **death rates**\n*   Between 1994 and 2013, an average of **218 million** people were affected by natural disasters every year, and **1.35 million** people died, resulting in an annual average of **68,000 deaths**\n\n\n### Megadiasasters\n\n\n\n*   A **mega disaster** is an event that kills more than 100,000 people. Some megasisaters between 1994–2013 are:\n    *   The **Asian tsunami 2004**, 225,000 in 12 counties\n    *   The **Cyclone Nargis 2008**, 138,000 in Myanmar\n    *   The **Haiti earthquake 2004**, 220,000\n*   Earthquakes and tsunamis are rarer than floods but cause higher number of casualties in shorter periods of time\n*   Urbanization within highly seismic zones has increased significantly over recent decades\n    *   Slums and squatter settlements frequently expand onto high-risk areas such as slopes and embankments due to the lack of any other suitable places\n    *   In Haiti, there were not adequate housing\n*   More people are ecming susceptible to natural disasters as a result of growth and urbanization, and disastrous outcomes are likely to increase unless improved ways of migration, forecasting, and warning, community preparedness, and resilience are developed\n    *   Solutions to disasters include help from international agencies, national governments, NGOs, and local communities\n\nWhy there is an increasing impact\n\n\n\n*   An explanation for the increasing impact of geophysical events is that there are increasingly more people in high-risk areas\n*   Human activities may be changing the climate and land use, leading to greater impacts of landslides\n*   The concentration of people in large urban areas, combined with **environmental degradation** makes communities more vulnerable\n    *   Destruction of **mangrove swamps** in Sri Lanka increased the vulnerability of coastal communities to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami\n    *   In Limbe in SW Cameroon, shanty towns have been built at the base of slopes that have been made unstable by undercutting, leading to an increase in landslides in the rainy season\n\n\n### Impacts of extreme disasters\n\n\n\n*   Global economic crises\n*   Deaths\n*   Possible destruction of megacities\n*   Environmental refugees\n*   Environmental degradation\n*   Disruption of global food supplies\n*   Disruption of transport and communications\n*   Pollution \n*   Climate stress\n\nTackling global problems\n\n\n\n*   Montreal Protocol, Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement, the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA)\n\n\n### Identifying areas at risk\n\n\n\n*   It is not possible to communicate with those who need to know\n*   Not possible to predict the exact timing, impact, and magnitude of an earthquake\n\n\n### Population growth and urban growth\n\n\n\n*   The world’s population is expected to reach 11.2 billion by 2050, concentrated in India, Nigeria, Pakistan, DRC, Ethiopia, URT, USA, Indonesia, and Uganda; most of these are LICs, posing challenges of eradicating poverty and inequality, combating hunger and malnutrition, to provide adequate housing\n\n\n### Predictions, forecasts, and warnings\n\n\n#### Preparing\n\n\n\n*   Better forecasting and warning\n*   Improved building design and location\n*   Establishing emergency procedures\n\n\n#### Monitoring\n\n\n\n*   Small scale ground surface changes\n*   Small-scale uplift or subsidence\n*   Ground tilt\n*   Changes in rock stress\n*   Micro-earthquake activity\n*   Anomalies in the earth\'s magnetic field\n*   Changes in radon gas concentration\n*   Changes in electrical resistivity in rocks\n\n\n### Earthquake prediction\n\n\n\n*   Example: **Oarfish** in Japan, coming to the surface is an indication of a forthcoming earthquake\n\n[Never completed the following sections, but you probably should …]\n\n\n### Predicting volcanoes\n\n\n## Geophysical hazard adaptation\n\n\n### Preparedness\n\n\n### Tackling volcanoes\n\n\n### Volcanic eruption without warning\n\n\n## Pre-event management strategies\n\n\n### Managing landslides\n\n\n### Managing the risk of earthquakes\n\n\n### Tsunamis\n\n\n## Post-event management strategies\n\n\n### Short-term, mid-term, and long-term response (table)\n\n\n### Rescue, rehabilitation, and reconstruction in practice',html:'<h1>D.1 Geophysical systems</h1>\n<h2>Mechanisms of plate movement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Plates move through <strong>convection currents</strong> of the circular motion of the hot molten lava</li>\n<li><strong>Subduction</strong> refers to the plunging of one plate beneath another: the heavier, denser oceanic plate subducted under the lighter continental plate, and magma exits the mantle in the process</li>\n<li>Constructive plate boundaries: when two plates move away from each other, land is created as magma rises to fill the gap</li>\n<li>When this magma solidifies, land is formed</li>\n<li>Rifting occurs at constructive plate boundaries</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Volcanoes</h2>\n<div class="responsive-table">\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Shield\n   </td>\n   <td>Composite\n   </td>\n   <td>Cinder\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n<ul>\n<li>No explosives or ejected fragment\n<li>Very hot, runny, basaltic lava\n<li>Lava flows great distances\n<li>Gently sloping sides, shallow craters, large circumference\n</li>\n</ul>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n<ul>\n<li>Formed by alternating eruptions of fragmental material and lava outflows\n<li>Large explosions\n<li>Much larger crater\n<li>Secondary cones\n</li>\n</ul>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n<ul>\n<li>Formed by fragments of solid material\n<li>Not very tall\n<li>Violent eruption\n<li>Lava ejections\n</li>\n</ul>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Volcanic eruptions</h3>\n<div class="responsive-table">\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Lava\n   </td>\n   <td>Pyroclastic\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n<ul>\n<li>Lava becomes more thick and viscous when it absorbs <strong>silica-rich</strong> sediments\n<li>Large quantities of <strong>basaltic</strong> lava may build up vast horizontal plains\n<li>Runny <strong>basaltic</strong> lava flows down the sides of the volcano and gases escape easily\n<li>Volcanoes in Hawaii and Iceland erupt continuously\n<li>Volcanoes are infrequent\n</li>\n</ul>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n<ul>\n<li>White clouds of steam emitted by the crater\n<li>Pyroclastic flows are produced by Strombolian and Plinian eruptions\n<li>Plinian eruptions release clouds of pulverized rock and ash\n</li>\n</ul>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Volcanic hazards</h3>\n<div class="responsive-table">\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Primary\n   </td>\n   <td>Secondary\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n<ul>\n<li>Lava flows\n<li>Ash fallout\n<li>Pyroclastic flows\n<li>Gas emissions, such as in Cameron, 1986, as an effect of a <strong>Basaltic chamber of magma</strong>\n(Cameron contains many deep-crater lakes.

linear patterns\n<ul>\n<li>Linear chain follow plate boundaries,</li>\n<li>the center of the Atlantic Ocean</li>\n<li>around the Pacific Ocean: the Ring of Fire</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Broad belts of earthquakes are associated with subduction zones, whereas narrow belts of earthquakes are associated with constructive plate margins (new material is forming, plates move apart)</li>\n<li>Collision boundaries, such as the Himalayas, are associated with broad belts of earthquakes; conservative plate boundaries, such as California\'s SA fault line, give a relatively narrow belt of earthquakes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Volcanoes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Most are found at plate boundaries, although there are some exceptions\n<ul>\n<li>These include Hawaii, which occur over hotspots</li>\n<li>A <strong>hotspot</strong> or <strong>mantle plume</strong> (a jet of hot material rising from the deep within a mantle) is responsible for the volcanoes</li>\n<li>Hotspots play a role in the formation of new land</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Around ¾ of the Earth’s 550 historically active volcanoes lie along the Pacific Ring of Fire\n<ul>\n<li>It also includes many of the world’s most recent volcanoes such as Mt Pinatubo (Philippines), Mt Unzen (Japan), Mt Agung (Java)</li>\n<li>Caused by the subduction beneath either oceanic or continental crust</li>\n<li>Subduction in the oceans provides chains of volcanic islands known island arcs, such as the <strong>Aleutian islands</strong> formed by the Pacific subducting beneath the North American Plate</li>\n<li>The subduction of an oceanic crust occur beneath the continental crust, and young fold mountains are formed, such as <strong>The Andes</strong>, which have been formed where the Nazca subducts beneath the South American plate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Other area of active vulcanicity include Iceland, Montserrat in the Caribbean</li>\n<li>Some submarine volcanoes such as Kick ‘em Jenny off Grenda in the Caribbean are monitored</li>\n<li>Although deeper levels of the Earth are much hotter than the surface, rocks are not molten as the pressure is too high\n<ul>\n<li>There is molten rock along the plate boundaries, which feeds the volcanoes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Landslides</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Naturally occurring phenomena in every environment including the tropics, temperature readings, high latitudes, and the ocean</li>\n<li>Fatal landslides tend to be more common in areas that have\n<ul>\n<li>Active tectonic processes that lead to high rates of uplift and occasional seismic events</li>\n<li>High levels of precipitation, including high annual totals and high short-term intestines</li>\n<li>A high population density</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The most fatal landslides occur in Ncis where the migration schemes are less likely in place\n<ul>\n<li>Southern edge of Himalayan edge</li>\n<li>Central China</li>\n<li>South-west India</li>\n<li>Central Indonesia, the island of Java</li>\n<li>The caribbean and central Mexico</li>\n<li>Western edge of South America, especially Columbia</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The relevance of hazard magnitude and frequency/recurrence intervals for risk management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>recurrence interval</strong>/<strong>return period</strong> is the expected frequency in years for an event of aprtoucialr size\n<ul>\n<li>In general, small events have a high frequency/short return period, whereas large events have a very low frequency/high return period</li>\n<li>There are fewer highly destructive earthquakes, but many minor ones</li>\n<li>Low-frequency and high-magnitude events cause the most destruction and require the greatest management</li>\n<li>People are able to <strong>adapt</strong> and become less vulnerable to high-frequency disasters such as smaller earthquakes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Earthquake frequency and magnitude</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of the Richter scale, scientists are increasingly using the <strong>Movement MAgnitude Scale (M)</strong> which measure the amount of energy released</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Measuring volcanoes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Measured by the <strong>Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)</strong>, based on the amount of material ejected in the explosion, the height of the cloud created, and the amount of damage caused</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Geophysical hazard risk as a product of economic, social, demographic, and political factors</h2>\n<p>In general, LICs are more vulnerable than industrialized countries due to the following reasons</p>\n<p>Why do people live in hazard-prone places?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Behavioural school</strong>: environmental hazards are the result of natural hazards, and people put themselves at risk by living on or at the foot of steep slopes</li>\n<li><strong>Structuralist school</strong>: constraints places on poor people by prevailing social and political system of the country; poor people live in unsafe conditions, such as the slope of a hill because they are prevented from living in better areas</li>\n<li>The concept of <strong>vulnerability</strong> includes not only the physical effects of a natural hazard, but also the status of people and property in the affected area</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Economic factors</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Levels of wealth and development</strong>: in 1976, Guatemala, 20,000 people were killed by low-quality housing in ravines and gorges; this earthquake had a markedly class impact</li>\n<li><strong>Construction styles and building codes</strong>: In Sichuan 2008, following the 7.9 earthquake, government buildings remained standing while many schools were destroyed, suggesting that they were poorly build</li>\n<li><strong>Access to technology</strong>: in Japan, earthquake and tsunami warnings are issued to people via smartphones; people with greater access to communications are able to keep up to date with warnings and forecast</li>\n<li><strong>Insurance cover</strong>: the poor have no insurance, and are most likely to be affected in natural hazards as their housing quality is poor</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Social factors</h6>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Education</strong>: gives people higher income, better housing, greater understanding of nature and hazard events</li>\n<li><strong>Public education</strong>: programs in Japan have helped reduce the number of deaths</li>\n<li><strong>Awareness of hazards</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Gender</strong>: women are often carers, and are unable to leave an area even if they want to</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Demographic factors</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Population density</strong>: large urban areas, such as <strong>Port-au-Prince</strong> in Haiti are vulnerable to natural hazards</li>\n<li><strong>Age</strong>: 65% of deaths in Japan tsunami 2011 where aged over 60</li>\n<li><strong>Migrants</strong>: migrants may be unaware of some natural hazards present in an environment</li>\n<li><strong>Disability</strong>: mortality rate of disabled in Japan tsunami 2011 was twice that or normal population</li>\n<li><strong>Cultural factors</strong>: extend of train in governments, more</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Political factors</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nature of the society</strong>: the failure of the Burmese government increased the number of deaths from disease and malnutrition in the cyclone Nargis in 2008</li>\n<li><strong>Effectiveness of lines of communication</strong>: the Sichuan earthquake of 2008 got a swift response and mobilized 100,000 troops</li>\n<li><strong>Availability and readiness of emergency personnel</strong>: fewer deaths from Mt Pinatubo eruption as the USGS had minitoed the volcano closely</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Geographical factors affecting the impacts of geophysical events</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Magnitude and frequency of events</strong>: shallow-focus earthquakes are potentially more damaging that deep-focus earthquakes (overlying rocks absorb most of the energy)</li>\n<li><strong>Population density</strong>: a geophysical hazard hitting an urban area could inflict more damage to an urbanized area such as Tokyo\n<ul>\n<li>The 1985 8.0 Mexico city earthquake occurred in the city and killed around 5,000 people</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Type of buildings</strong>: HICs have better earthquake-resistant buildings, and people are more likely to have insurance cover than in LICs</li>\n<li><strong>Time of the day</strong>: earthquakes at busy times such as peak hours cause more deaths (this is less of a factor for volcanoes as they do not have a sudden onset)\n<ul>\n<li>The Sichuan 2008 earthquake 7,9 occurred at 14:00 pm, and ended up killing many school children too</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Types of rocks and sediments</strong>: liquefaction occurs when loose material is shaken, so buildings built on solid rock are much safer\n<ul>\n<li>The Casita volcano in Nicaragua caused landslides due to the unconsolidated volcanic sediments</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Secondary hazards</strong>: these can often cause more fatalities than the original event (tsunamis, fires, contaminated water, disease, hunger, hypothermia)\n<ul>\n<li>More people died due to lahars following the Pinatubo 1991 eruption than the volcanic eruption</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Economic development</strong>: HICs generally have a better level of preparedness and emergency response</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See research skills</p>\n<h1>Hazard risk and vulnerability</h1>\n<h2>Vulnerability</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vulnerability</strong> are the characteristics and circumstances of a community, system, or asset that make it susceptible to damaging effects of a hazard</li>\n<li>It is related to many factors:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical factors</strong>: poor design, construction, unregulated land use</li>\n<li><strong>Social factors</strong>: poverty and inequality – these groups are more vulnerable</li>\n<li><strong>Economic factors</strong>: those in the uninsured, informal sector, workers facing economic pressures are more vulnerable</li>\n<li><strong>Environmental factors</strong>: poor environmental management, overconsumption of natural resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Vulnerability explains how non-extreme hazards can lead to extreme impacts (due to factors above)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Risk</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Risk</strong> is the likelihood of loss of life, injury, or destruction and damage from a disaster in a given period of time</li>\n<li>Disaster risk = consequence of the interaction between <strong>hazards</strong> and characteristics that make people <strong>vulnerable</strong> and <strong>exposed</strong></li>\n<li>Managing risks is shared across a wide range of sectors:\n<ul>\n<li>Insurance sector: recovery from disaster losses</li>\n<li>Construction sector: so that buildings are built according to disaster codes</li>\n<li>Land-use and urban planning sectors: locations of new developments takes into account the likelihood of a hazard event</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Earthquake (CS)</h2>\n<p>[CS = case study]</p>\n<p>[Never completed this, but you should]</p>\n<h2>Volcanic eruptions (CS)</h2>\n<h2>Mass movements

and future predictions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Geophysical hazard frequency between 1994 and 2013 has remained relatively constant, while population growth and economic development has varied considerably and increased</li>\n<li>LICs bear a disproportionate burden to national disasters, including disparities in <strong>death rates</strong></li>\n<li>Between 1994 and 2013, an average of <strong>218 million</strong> people were affected by natural disasters every year, and <strong>1.35 million</strong> people died, resulting in an annual average of <strong>68,000 deaths</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Megadiasasters</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>mega disaster</strong> is an event that kills more than 100,000 people. Some megasisaters between 1994–2013 are:\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Asian tsunami 2004</strong>, 225,000 in 12 counties</li>\n<li>The <strong>Cyclone Nargis 2008</strong>, 138,000 in Myanmar</li>\n<li>The <strong>Haiti earthquake 2004</strong>, 220,000</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Earthquakes and tsunamis are rarer than floods but cause higher number of casualties in shorter periods of time</li>\n<li>Urbanization within highly seismic zones has increased significantly over recent decades\n<ul>\n<li>Slums and squatter settlements frequently expand onto high-risk areas such as slopes and embankments due to the lack of any other suitable places</li>\n<li>In Haiti, there were not adequate housing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>More people are ecming susceptible to natural disasters as a result of growth and urbanization, and disastrous outcomes are likely to increase unless improved ways of migration, forecasting, and warning, community preparedness, and resilience are developed\n<ul>\n<li>Solutions to disasters include help from international agencies, national governments, NGOs, and local communities</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why there is an increasing impact</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An explanation for the increasing impact of geophysical events is that there are increasingly more people in high-risk areas</li>\n<li>Human activities may be changing the climate and land use, leading to greater impacts of landslides</li>\n<li>The concentration of people in large urban areas, combined with <strong>environmental degradation</strong> makes communities more vulnerable\n<ul>\n<li>Destruction of <strong>mangrove swamps</strong> in Sri Lanka increased the vulnerability of coastal communities to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami</li>\n<li>In Limbe in SW Cameroon, shanty towns have been built at the base of slopes that have been made unstable by undercutting, leading to an increase in landslides in the rainy season</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Impacts of extreme disasters</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Global economic crises</li>\n<li>Deaths</li>\n<li>Possible destruction of megacities</li>\n<li>Environmental

Earthquakes\n\n\n\n*   An **earthquake** is a series of seismic vibrations or shock waves which originate from the **focus**\n    *   The **focus** is the point at which the quakes release their tension or compression suddenly\n    *   The **epicenter** is the point on the surface of the earth immediately above the **focus** of the earthquake\n*   There are **shallow-deep earthquakes** (occur close to ground surface) and **deep-focus earthquakes** (occur at considerable depth)\n*   A large earthquake can be preceded by smaller tremors known as **foreshocks** and followed by numerous **aftershocks**\n\n\n### Wave types\n\n<div class="responsive-table">\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Primary\n   </td>\n   <td>Secondary\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n

plates, this increases stress on rocks, the rocks deform and eventually snap\n*   The snapping releases energy (earthquake)\n\n\n### Human triggers\n\n\n\n*   Some earthquakes occur a long way from any plate boundary as a result of human activity\n*   In **Denver, Colorado, 1960**, waste water contaminated by chemical warfare agents were injected into underlying rocks\n    *   From 1962–5, over 700 minor earthquakes were reported although no real damage was caused\n    *   The injection of this water lubricated and reactivated underground faults which had been inactive\n*   Fracking involves injecting water into rocks at high pressures, and has been associated with triggering earthquakes in the UK – in 2011, it led to a 2.3 in Lancashire\n*   The weight of water behind large reservoirs also created earthquake, such as in 1935, the Colorado river was dammed by the Hoover dam to create Lake Mead\n    *   The underlying rocks had an increased load, causing 6,000 earthquake in the next 10 years, although none caused damage\n\n\n### Resultant hazards of earthquakes\n\n<div class="responsive-table">\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Primary\n   </td>\n   <td>Secondary\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n

not accompanied by a moving agent such as a river, glaciers, or ocean waves, including\n    *   Soil creep (slow)\n    *   Avalanches (very fast)\n    *   Rockfalls (dry)\n    *   Mudflows (fluid)\n*   The processes affecting magnitude, frequency, and scale of mass movements are\n    *   Type of movement: flows, slides, slumps\n    *   Speed of movement\n    *   Water content\n    *   Material\n    *   Slope/gravity \n\n\n### Causes of mass movements\n\n\n\n*   Shear strength: a reduction in internal resistance of the slope\n*   Shear stress: increase in forces attempting to pull a mass downslope\n\nTable: Increasing and decreasing resistance\n\nCase study: Neap landslide, 2015\n\n\n\n*   Factors that trigger landslides include\n    *   Seasonal rainfall\n    *   Road construction\n    *   Slopes weakened by previous slides\n*   These factors contributed to the landslides during the Gorkha earthquake of April 2015\n*   One of the largest was an ice and rock landslide at Langtang\n*   The vertical distance was 700–800 m and the horizontal distance was 2–3 km\n\n\n# D.2 Geophysical hazard risks\n\n\n## Spatial distribution of geophysical hazard events\n\n\n### Earthquakes\n\n\n\n*   There are clearly defined linear patterns\n    *   Linear chain follow plate boundaries,\n    *   the center of the Atlantic Ocean\n    *   around the Pacific Ocean: the Ring of Fire\n*   Broad belts of earthquakes are associated with subduction zones, whereas narrow belts of earthquakes are associated with constructive plate margins (new material is forming, plates move apart)\n*   Collision boundaries, such as the Himalayas, are associated with broad belts of earthquakes; conservative plate boundaries, such as California\'s SA fault line, give a relatively narrow belt of earthquakes\n\n\n### Volcanoes\n\n\n\n*   Most are found at plate boundaries, although there are some exceptions\n    *   These include Hawaii, which occur over hotspots\n    *   A **hotspot** or **mantle plume** (a jet of hot material rising from the deep within a mantle) is responsible for the volcanoes\n    *   Hotspots play a role in the formation of new land\n*   Around ¾ of the Earth’s 550 historically active volcanoes lie along the Pacific Ring of Fire \n    *   It also includes many of the world’s most recent volcanoes such as Mt Pinatubo (Philippines), Mt Unzen (Japan), Mt Agung (Java)\n    *   Caused by the subduction beneath either oceanic or continental crust\n    *   Subduction in the oceans provides chains of volcanic islands known island arcs, such as the **Aleutian islands** formed by the Pacific subducting beneath the North American Plate\n    *   The subduction of an oceanic crust occur beneath the continental crust, and young fold mountains are formed, such as **The Andes**, which have been formed where the Nazca subducts beneath the South American plate.\n*   Other area of active vulcanicity include Iceland, Montserrat in the Caribbean\n*   Some submarine volcanoes such as Kick ‘em Jenny off Grenda in the Caribbean are monitored \n*   Although deeper levels of the Earth are much hotter than the surface, rocks are not molten as the pressure is too high\n    *   There is molten rock along the plate boundaries, which feeds the volcanoes\n\n\n### Landslides\n\n\n\n*   Naturally occurring phenomena in every environment including the tropics, temperature readings, high latitudes, and the ocean\n*   Fatal landslides tend to be more common in areas that have\n    *   Active tectonic processes that lead to high rates of uplift and occasional seismic events\n    *   High levels of precipitation, including high annual totals and high short-term intestines\n    *   A high population density\n*   The most fatal landslides occur in Ncis where the migration schemes are less likely in place\n    *   Southern edge of Himalayan edge\n    *   Central China\n    *   South-west India\n    *   Central Indonesia, the island of Java\n    *   The caribbean and central Mexico\n    *   Western edge of South America, especially Columbia\n\n\n## The relevance of hazard magnitude and frequency/recurrence intervals for risk management \n\n\n\n*   The **recurrence interval**/**return period** is the expected frequency in years for an event of aprtoucialr size\n    *   In general, small events have a high frequency/short return period, whereas large events have a very low frequency/high return period\n    *   There are fewer highly destructive earthquakes, but many minor ones\n    *   Low-frequency and high-magnitude events cause the most destruction and require the greatest management\n    *   People are able to **adapt** and become less vulnerable to high-frequency disasters such as smaller earthquakes\n\n\n### Earthquake frequency and magnitude\n\n\n\n*   Instead of the Richter scale, scientists are increasingly using the **Movement MAgnitude Scale (M)** which measure the amount of energy released\n\n\n### Measuring volcanoes\n\n\n\n*   Measured by the **Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)**, based on the amount of material ejected in the explosion, the height of the cloud created, and the amount of damage caused\n\n\n## Geophysical hazard risk as a product of economic, social, demographic, and political factors\n\nIn general, LICs are more vulnerable than industrialized countries due to the following reasons\n\nWhy do people live in hazard-prone places?\n\n\n\n*   **Behavioural school**: environmental hazards are the result of natural hazards, and people put themselves at risk by living on or at the foot of steep slopes\n*   **Structuralist school**: constraints places on poor people by prevailing social and political system of the country; poor people live in unsafe conditions, such as the slope of a hill because they are prevented from living in better areas\n*   The concept of **vulnerability** includes not only the physical effects of a natural hazard, but also the status of people and property in the affected area\n\n\n### Economic factors\n\n\n\n*   **Levels of wealth and development**: in 1976, Guatemala, 20,000 people were killed by low-quality housing in ravines and gorges; this earthquake had a markedly class impact\n*   **Construction styles and building codes**: In Sichuan 2008, following the 7.9 earthquake, government buildings remained standing while many schools were destroyed, suggesting that they were poorly build\n*   **Access to technology**: in Japan, earthquake and tsunami warnings are issued to people via smartphones; people with greater access to communications are able to keep up to date with warnings and forecast \n*   **Insurance cover**: the poor have no insurance, and are most likely to be affected in natural hazards as their housing quality is poor\n\n\n###### Social factors\n\n\n\n*   **Education**: gives people higher income, better housing, greater understanding of nature and hazard events\n*   **Public education**: programs in Japan have helped reduce the number of deaths\n*   **Awareness of hazards**\n*   **Gender**: women are often carers, and are unable to leave an area even if they want to\n\n\n### Demographic factors\n\n\n\n*   **Population density**: large urban areas, such as **Port-au-Prince** in Haiti are vulnerable to natural hazards\n*   **Age**: 65% of deaths in Japan tsunami 2011 where aged over 60\n*   **Migrants**: migrants may be unaware of some natural hazards present in an environment\n*   **Disability**: mortality rate of disabled in Japan tsunami 2011 was twice that or normal population\n*   **Cultural factors**: extend of train in governments, more\n\n\n### Political factors\n\n\n\n*   **Nature of the society**: the failure of the Burmese government increased the number of deaths from disease and malnutrition in the cyclone Nargis in 2008\n*   **Effectiveness of lines of communication**: the Sichuan earthquake of 2008 got a swift response and mobilized 100,000 troops\n*   **Availability and readiness of emergency personnel**: fewer deaths from Mt Pinatubo eruption as the USGS had minitoed the volcano closely\n\n\n## Geographical factors affecting the impacts of geophysical events\n\n\n\n*   **Magnitude and frequency of events**: shallow-focus earthquakes are potentially more damaging that deep-focus earthquakes (overlying rocks absorb most of the energy)\n*   **Population density**: a geophysical hazard hitting an urban area could inflict more damage to an urbanized area such as Tokyo\n    *   The 1985 8.0 Mexico city earthquake occurred in the city and killed around 5,000 people\n*   **Type of buildings**: HICs have better earthquake-resistant buildings, and people are more likely to have insurance cover than in LICs \n*   **Time of the day**: earthquakes at busy times such as peak hours cause more deaths (this is less of a factor for volcanoes as they do not have a sudden onset)\n    *   The Sichuan 2008 earthquake 7,9 occurred at 14:00 pm, and ended up killing many school children too\n*   **Types of rocks and sediments**: liquefaction occurs when loose material is shaken, so buildings built on solid rock are much safer\n    *   The Casita volcano in Nicaragua caused landslides due to the unconsolidated volcanic sediments\n*   **Secondary hazards**: these can often cause more fatalities than the original event (tsunamis, fires, contaminated water, disease, hunger, hypothermia)\n    *   More people died due to lahars following the Pinatubo 1991 eruption than the volcanic eruption\n*   **Economic development**: HICs generally have a better level of preparedness and emergency response\n\nSee research skills\n\n\n# Hazard risk and vulnerability\n\n\n## Vulnerability\n\n\n\n*   **Vulnerability** are the characteristics and circumstances of a community, system, or asset that make it susceptible to damaging effects of a hazard\n*   It is related to many factors:\n    *   **Physical factors**: poor design, construction, unregulated land use\n    *   **Social factors**: poverty and inequality – these groups are more vulnerable\n    *   **Economic factors**: those in the uninsured, informal sector, workers facing economic pressures are more vulnerable\n    *   **Environmental factors**: poor environmental management, overconsumption of natural resources\n*   Vulnerability explains how non-extreme hazards can lead to extreme impacts (due to factors above)\n\n\n## Risk\n\n\n\n*   **Risk** is the likelihood of loss of life, injury, or destruction and damage from a disaster in a given period of time\n*   Disaster risk = consequence of the interaction between **hazards** and characteristics that make people **vulnerable** and **exposed**\n*   Managing risks is shared across a wide range of sectors:\n    *   Insurance sector: recovery from disaster losses\n    *   Construction sector: so that buildings are built according to disaster codes\n    *   Land-use and urban planning sectors: locations of new developments takes into account the likelihood of a hazard event\n\n\n## Earthquake (CS)\n\n[CS = case study]\n\n[Never completed this, but you should]\n\n## Volcanic eruptions (CS)\n\n\n## Mass movements (CS)\n\n\n# Future resilience and adaptation\n\n\n\n*   This topic deals with the preparedness of various places to the hazard events\n\n\n## Global geophysical hazard disaster trends and future predictions\n\n\n\n*   Geophysical hazard frequency between 1994 and 2013 has remained relatively constant, while population growth and economic development has varied considerably and increased\n*   LICs bear a disproportionate burden to national disasters, including disparities in **death rates**\n*   Between 1994 and 2013, an average of **218 million** people were affected by natural disasters every year, and **1.35 million** people died, resulting in an annual average of **68,000 deaths**\n\n\n### Megadiasasters\n\n\n\n*   A **mega disaster** is an

linear patterns\n<ul>\n<li>Linear chain follow plate boundaries,</li>\n<li>the center of the Atlantic Ocean</li>\n<li>around the Pacific Ocean: the Ring of Fire</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Broad belts of earthquakes are associated with subduction zones, whereas narrow belts of earthquakes are associated with constructive plate margins (new material is forming, plates move apart)</li>\n<li>Collision boundaries, such as the Himalayas, are associated with broad belts of earthquakes; conservative plate boundaries, such as California\'s SA fault line, give a relatively narrow belt of earthquakes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Volcanoes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Most are found at plate boundaries, although there are some exceptions\n<ul>\n<li>These include Hawaii, which occur over hotspots</li>\n<li>A <strong>hotspot</strong> or <strong>mantle plume</strong> (a jet of hot material rising from the deep within a mantle) is responsible for the volcanoes</li>\n<li>Hotspots play a role in the formation of new land</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Around ¾ of the Earth’s 550 historically active volcanoes lie along the Pacific Ring of Fire\n<ul>\n<li>It also includes many of the world’s most recent volcanoes such as Mt Pinatubo (Philippines), Mt Unzen (Japan), Mt Agung (Java)</li>\n<li>Caused by the subduction beneath either oceanic or continental crust</li>\n<li>Subduction in the oceans provides chains of volcanic islands known island arcs, such as the <strong>Aleutian islands</strong> formed by the Pacific subducting beneath the North American Plate</li>\n<li>The subduction of an oceanic crust occur beneath the continental crust, and young fold mountains are formed, such as <strong>The Andes</strong>, which have been formed where the Nazca subducts beneath the South American plate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Other area of active vulcanicity include Iceland, Montserrat in the Caribbean</li>\n<li>Some submarine volcanoes such as Kick ‘em Jenny off Grenda in the Caribbean are monitored</li>\n<li>Although deeper levels of the Earth are much hotter than the surface, rocks are not molten as the pressure is too high\n<ul>\n<li>There is molten rock along the plate boundaries, which feeds the volcanoes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Landslides</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Naturally occurring phenomena in every environment including the tropics, temperature readings, high latitudes, and the ocean</li>\n<li>Fatal landslides tend to be more common in areas that have\n<ul>\n<li>Active tectonic processes that lead to high rates of uplift and occasional seismic events</li>\n<li>High levels of precipitation, including high annual totals and high short-term intestines</li>\n<li>A high population density</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The most fatal landslides occur in Ncis where the migration schemes are less likely in place\n<ul>\n<li>Southern edge of Himalayan edge</li>\n<li>Central China</li>\n<li>South-west India</li>\n<li>Central Indonesia, the island of Java</li>\n<li>The caribbean and central Mexico</li>\n<li>Western edge of South America, especially Columbia</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The relevance of hazard magnitude and frequency/recurrence intervals for risk management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>recurrence interval</strong>/<strong>return period</strong> is the expected frequency in years for an event of aprtoucialr size\n<ul>\n<li>In general, small events have a high frequency/short return period, whereas large events have a very low frequency/high return period</li>\n<li>There are fewer highly destructive earthquakes, but many minor ones</li>\n<li>Low-frequency and high-magnitude events cause the most destruction and require the greatest management</li>\n<li>People are able to <strong>adapt</strong> and become less vulnerable to high-frequency disasters such as smaller earthquakes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Earthquake frequency and magnitude</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of the Richter scale, scientists are increasingly using the <strong>Movement MAgnitude Scale (M)</strong> which measure the amount of energy released</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Measuring volcanoes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Measured by the <strong>Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)</strong>, based on the amount of material ejected in the explosion, the height of the cloud created, and the amount of damage caused</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Geophysical hazard risk as a product of economic, social, demographic, and political factors</h2>\n<p>In general, LICs are more vulnerable than industrialized countries due to the following reasons</p>\n<p>Why do people live in hazard-prone places?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Behavioural school</strong>: environmental hazards are the result of natural hazards, and people put themselves at risk by living on or at the foot of steep slopes</li>\n<li><strong>Structuralist school</strong>: constraints places on poor people by prevailing social and political system of the country; poor people live in unsafe conditions, such as the slope of a hill because they are prevented from living in better areas</li>\n<li>The concept of <strong>vulnerability</strong> includes not only the physical effects of a natural hazard, but also the status of people and property in the affected area</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Economic factors</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Levels of wealth and development</strong>: in 1976, Guatemala, 20,000 people were killed by low-quality housing in ravines and gorges; this earthquake had a markedly class impact</li>\n<li><strong>Construction styles and building codes</strong>: In Sichuan 2008, following the 7.9 earthquake, government buildings remained standing while many schools were destroyed, suggesting that they were poorly build</li>\n<li><strong>Access to technology</strong>: in Japan, earthquake and tsunami warnings are issued to people via smartphones; people with greater access to communications are able to keep up to date with warnings and forecast</li>\n<li><strong>Insurance cover</strong>: the poor have no insurance, and are most likely to be affected in natural hazards as their housing quality is poor</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Social factors</h6>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Education</strong>: gives people higher income, better housing, greater understanding of nature and hazard events</li>\n<li><strong>Public education</strong>: programs in Japan have helped reduce the number of deaths</li>\n<li><strong>Awareness of hazards</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Gender</strong>: women are often carers, and are unable to leave an area even if they want to</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Demographic factors</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Population density</strong>: large urban areas, such as <strong>Port-au-Prince</strong> in Haiti are vulnerable to natural hazards</li>\n<li><strong>Age</strong>: 65% of deaths in Japan tsunami 2011 where aged over 60</li>\n<li><strong>Migrants</strong>: migrants may be unaware of some natural hazards present in an environment</li>\n<li><strong>Disability</strong>: mortality rate of disabled in Japan tsunami 2011 was twice that or normal population</li>\n<li><strong>Cultural factors</strong>: extend of train in governments, more</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Political factors</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nature of the society</strong>: the failure of the Burmese government increased the number of deaths from disease and malnutrition in the cyclone Nargis in 2008</li>\n<li><strong>Effectiveness of lines of communication</strong>: the Sichuan earthquake of 2008 got a swift response and mobilized 100,000 troops</li>\n<li><strong>Availability and readiness of emergency personnel</strong>: fewer deaths from Mt Pinatubo eruption as the USGS had minitoed the volcano closely</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Geographical factors affecting the impacts of geophysical events</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Magnitude and frequency of events</strong>: shallow-focus earthquakes are potentially more damaging that deep-focus earthquakes (overlying rocks absorb most of the energy)</li>\n<li><strong>Population density</strong>: a geophysical hazard hitting an urban area could inflict more damage to an urbanized area such as Tokyo\n<ul>\n<li>The 1985 8.0 Mexico city earthquake occurred in the city and killed around 5,000 people</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Type of buildings</strong>: HICs have better earthquake-resistant buildings, and people are more likely to have insurance cover than in LICs</li>\n<li><strong>Time of the day</strong>: earthquakes at busy times such as peak hours cause more deaths (this is less of a factor for volcanoes as they do not have a sudden onset)\n<ul>\n<li>The Sichuan 2008 earthquake 7,9 occurred at 14:00 pm, and ended up killing many school children too</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Types of rocks and sediments</strong>: liquefaction occurs when loose material is shaken, so buildings built on solid rock are much safer\n<ul>\n<li>The Casita volcano in Nicaragua caused landslides due to the unconsolidated volcanic sediments</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Secondary hazards</strong>: these can often cause more fatalities than the original event (tsunamis, fires, contaminated water, disease, hunger, hypothermia)\n<ul>\n<li>More people died due to lahars following the Pinatubo 1991 eruption than the volcanic eruption</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Economic development</strong>: HICs generally have a better level of preparedness and emergency response</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See research skills</p>\n<h1>Hazard risk and vulnerability</h1>\n<h2>Vulnerability</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vulnerability</strong> are the characteristics and circumstances of a community, system, or asset that make it susceptible to damaging effects of a hazard</li>\n<li>It is related to many factors:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical factors</strong>: poor design, construction, unregulated land use</li>\n<li><strong>Social factors</strong>: poverty and inequality – these groups are more vulnerable</li>\n<li><strong>Economic factors</strong>: those in the uninsured, informal sector, workers facing economic pressures are more vulnerable</li>\n<li><strong>Environmental factors</strong>: poor environmental management, overconsumption of natural resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Vulnerability explains how non-extreme hazards can lead to extreme impacts (due to factors above)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Risk</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Risk</strong> is the likelihood of loss of life, injury, or destruction and damage from a disaster in a given period of time</li>\n<li>Disaster risk = consequence of the interaction between <strong>hazards</strong> and characteristics that make people <strong>vulnerable</strong> and <strong>exposed</strong></li>\n<li>Managing risks is shared across a wide range of sectors:\n<ul>\n<li>Insurance sector: recovery from disaster losses</li>\n<li>Construction sector: so that buildings are built according to disaster codes</li>\n<li>Land-use and urban planning sectors: locations of new developments takes into account the likelihood of a hazard

<strong>Haiti earthquake 2004</strong>, 220,000</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Earthquakes and tsunamis are rarer than floods but cause higher number of casualties in shorter periods of time</li>\n<li>Urbanization within highly seismic zones has increased significantly over recent decades\n<ul>\n<li>Slums and squatter settlements frequently expand onto high-risk areas such as slopes and embankments due to the lack of any other suitable places</li>\n<li>In Haiti, there were not adequate housing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>More people are ecming susceptible to natural disasters as a

activity or experience that takes place on non-work time, including sport, recreation, and tourism\n*   **Recreation** is a leisure-time activity undertaken voluntarily and for enjoyment, including individual pursuits, organized outings and events, and non-paid (non-professional) sports\n*   **Sport** is a physical activity involving events and competitions at the national and international scale with professional participants\n*   **Tourism** is travel away from home for at least one night for the purpose of leisure\n*   The range of leisure activities is expanding rapidly with the development of societies to support enthusiasts\n*   Leisure time has grown because of a\n    *   Reaction in the length of the working day and week\n    *   Increase in wages\n    *   Increase in disposable income\n    *   Growth of leisure activities\n    *   More early retirement\n    *   Increase in self-employment or flexitime\n    *   Developments in technology (such as washing machines), giving people more time and opportunities for leisure\n*   Men usually have more leisure time than females due to household and parenting responsibilities, although this is changing\n*   LICs have less disposable income, and therefore a lower change in engaging in leisure activities\n*   As LE increases, pursuing leisure activities is more important as adults benefit from it physically, socially, emotionally, and culturally\n\n\n## Categorization of tourism and sports\n\n\n\n*   Primary tourist resources are the pre-existing attractions for tourism or recreation (climate, scenery, wildlife, indigenous people, cultural heritage sites)\n\n\n## Case study: changes in China’s leisure activities\n\n\n\n*   In 2015,\n    *   22% of people spend 1–2 hours/day on leisure activities\n    *   16% spend 3–4\n    *   12% spend 4–5%, the rest spend more than 5 hours\n*   About ⅓ of people spend their leisure time reading and ⅙ watching TV, partially because China is becoming more rich, and the middle classes are also growing\n*   There are various leisure activities\n    *   ⅓ of chinese adults spend time on the internet through mobile phone/laptop\n    *   Shopping is enjoyed by women mostly\n    *   Sports include table tennis and badminton: there are various free badminton courts in sporting clubs\n    *   Other activities include chess, cards, dancing, and jogging, in chinese parks\n*   An increasing amount of the middle class are taking part in leisure and sport\n    *   **33.9%** of the population between 7 and 70 exercise regularly and **60.7%** of the urban population go to sports clubs to engage in fitness activities\n*   However, many do not have time to engage in these activities\n    *   For example, migrants work long hours, and are tired (physically and mentally), so they do not taking part in sports and other leisure activities\n    *   They do not have much disposable income, and if they do, they send it to their family or abroad\n    *   Some do have free time, but spend it studying\n    *   In 2015, around **227 M** migrant workers were in the workforce\n*   Children's leisure activities are also changing\n    *   The most popular activities used to be homework, extra reading, and academic training programmes\n    *   After 1995, Saturday schools ceased, so leisure activities and vacations were more orgazies, and summer camps were started\n*   China's leisure activities are getting more similar to that of the Western world including USA\n    *   In 2016, the Wanda group opened **Wanda city** in **Nanchang**, which is rival to Disney world\n    *   In 2016, Disney also opened a resort in Shanghai, **Mickey Mao**, and is expected to become the world's most visited park with **50 M** guests/year\n\n\n## Cast study: sports participation in the UK\n\n\n\n*   Participation in sport is greater among younger people, those with a car, students, and those in higher income bands\n    *   Those most likely **not** to participate in sport include those aged over 67, black, minority, lone pensioners, local authority tenants, those with no qualifications, sick, and disabled\n    *   People who participate in sports as children are more likely to participate as adults\n*   The most popular sports vary by sex\n    *   Women: swimming, heath, fitness, cycling\n*   It also varies by personality\n    *   Some people take more risk, and eniy sports like rock-climbing, and mountaineering\n\n\n# E.2 Tourism and sport the local and national scale\n\n\n## Case study: national sports league, Rugby in South Africa\n\n\n\n*   Rugby is one of SA’s biggest sports along with soccer and cricket\n*   The **Currie Cup**\n    *   The currie cup was the first rugby competition in SA in 1892\n    *   The format varies from year to year and the finals were held intermittently until 1968, after which the finals had become an annual event\n    *   Up to 2015, the most successfully province in the history of the Currie Cup was the Western province (Western Cape) with 33 titles, followed by the Blue Bulls with 23 titles\n    *   Sunce rugby become a professional sport in the early 1990s, no single team has dominated the cup\n    *   For many years, the biggest rivalry in South African rugby was between Western Province and the Blue Bulls\n        *   During the early to mid-1990s, there was a three-way rivalry between Natal, the Lions, and Western Province\n    *   The **Currie Cup** takes place yearly between July and October, with 14 teams\n*   The **Vodacom Cup**\n    *   The Vodacom Cup has become an important competitor on the SA rugby calendar\n    *   It takes place at the same time as the **Super 14** competition, starting in late February, and finishing in mid-May, thus creating a platform for young players who might otherwise not get a chance to play for a team\n    *   This has also allowed people from disadvantaged backgrounds to play\n*   Most supporters are within the province, although many of the fanbase has moved for university/home, or marriage\n\n\n## Case study: the Glastonbury rural Festival\n\n\n\n*   The **Glastonbury Festival** is the largest open-air music festival in Europe, and is globally recognized\n*   It is **cultural tourism** that embraces many activities: visiting **heritage sites, exploring historical and religious festivals, and attending music and fine arts drama festivals**\n*   Festival goers are attracted by the opportunity to see a particular type of performance or particular performer and to be a part of the festival cultures: this also presents an opportunity to socialize with friends\n\n\n### Development\n\n\n\n*   The festival began as the **Pilton Pop Festival** in 1970, and has been held every year, except for 2001 since its inauguration\n*   It is an open air festival which covers approximately 800 acres, and the site now accommodates 250,000 people\n\n\n### Impacts of the festival\n\n\n\n*   Economic impacts include\n    *   The Mendip local authority area, Shepton Mallet, Street and Wells, and their rural hinterland, Bristol and Bath, the South-West region, and the UK all benefit financially from the festival\n    *   Each visitor spends an average £293, and this income makes contributions to charities such as Water Aid, Greenpeace, and Oxfam\n        *   The money is also used to support local projects such as the provision of school and sporting facilities\n    *   However, there are a number of negative impacts too, such as drug, substance abuse, and theft, owing to the increasing amount of tourists\n*   Growth of Glastonbury\n    *   The festival is now welcomed by the local community as it is associated with rebellion and hippie culture\n    *   Civic pride is derived from hosting a global event\n    *   It offers local people an employment opportunity\n*   There are also various environmental impacts\n    *   Air pollution\n        *   CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increase dramatically during June on the 3-day festival\n        *   Car transport is popular due to its flexibility, although attempts to encourage supporters to use public transport are being made\n        *   Green coaches using environmentally acceptable fuels are also encouraged\n    *   Waste disposal\n        *   Waste creation is one of the biggest problems\n        *   Waste mainly consists of human waste, plastic bottles, and tents\n        *   Many tourists leave behind tents: ⅙ tents were left behind in 2006\n    *   Noise pollution\n        *   This causes a disturbance to the locals\n    *   Provision of resources\n        *   Energy, water, and food need to be supplied\n\n\n## Case study: Killarney National Park, Ireland\n\n\n\n*   The region relies heavily on tourism as a source of employment and revenue as the amount of paid holidays, disposable income, and transport infrastructure has increased, so the number of tourists visiting has also increased\n\n\n### Location\n\n\n\n*   One of the most visited tourists venues in Ireland\n*   Over a million visitors travel to Kerry each year, bringing an estimated £160 M to the area\n*   Resident population of 14,000 with over 4.000 tourist rooms\n*   The scenic quality is made of a variety of physical and human landscapes including the three lakes of Killarney, secluded lake shores, limestone cliffs, rocks and islands, waterfalls and rapidly flowing rivers, rugged sandstone mountains, eroded valleys, native wood oaklands, and historical buildings and ruins\n\n\n### National park\n\n\n\n*   The Killarney National Park is managed by the Office of Public WOrks (OPW) and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve by the UNESCO\n*   National Parks in Ireland are areas that exist to “_exist to conserve natural plant and animal communities and scenic landscapes which are both extensive and of national importance and, under conditions compatible with that purpose, to enable the public to visit and appreciate them_” \n*   The main objective of the National Park are to\n    *   Conserve nature and other significant features and qualities\n    *   Encourage public appreciation of the heritage and the need for conservation\n    *   Develop a harmonious relationship between the park and the community\n    *   Enable to park to contribute to science through environmental monitoring and research\n\n\n### Management strategy\n\n\n\n*   The Killarney park does not comprise a self-contained ecological unit as it is influenced by changes and developments that take place in the surrounding areas\n*   There are four main zones\n    *   Natural zone: nature conservation is the primary objective\n    *   Cultural zone: conservation of airworthy features resulting from human activities is the primary objective\n    *   Intensive management zone: basic park objectives other than conservation are emphasized\n    *   Resource restoration zone\n\n\n### Challenges\n\n\n\n*   Control and eradication of the Rhododendron population is the biggest challenges\n    *   Up to 900 ha of the park’s 11,200 ha of native woodland are infested\n\n\n# E.3 Tourism and sport at the international scale\n\n\n## Case study: Machu Picchu, a heritage tourism\n\n\n\n*   Machu Picchu was a center of worship\n*   It is a World Heritage Site and in 2007, was selected as one of the New7Wonders of the work\n*   It is one of the most attractive cultural sites in Latin America to tourists all around the world\n*   However, there are many problems in managing tourism pressures\n    *   UNESCO authorities are worried about **deforestation**, the risk of **landslides**, uncontrolled **urban development**, and illegal access to the sanctuary\n    *   UNESCO has considered adding the site to the endangered list, but has not so far\n    *   The Ministry of Culture is thinking of limiting the day pass to three hours, and limiting the time spent at each point\n    *   Currently, only **400 people per day** are allowed to climb **Huayna Picchu**, and there is a limit of **500 daily permits** for the **Inca trail**\n    *   There are plans for roads and cable cars to access Machu Picchu, apart from only the railways\n*   New regulations have been put in place\n    *   Visitors need to be organized in groups of at most 20 people for easier management\n    *   Guides will have to wear uniforms with clearly visible credentials\n    *   Visitors are prevented from leaving an organized group and joining another\n    *   Time limit of 3–5 minutes to stop and appreciate Machu Picchu’s significant and sacred points of interest inlucid the **Intihuatana**, and the **Temple of the Condor**, to prevent bottleneck traffic jams\n    *   Signs that say “Keep Moving”\n*   However, tour operators are firmly against the new restrictions\n*   Since 2011, the daily average number of visitors at Machu Picchu has far exceeded the daily limit of 2,500 as agreed to by Peru and the UNESCO\n\n\n## Case study: role of TNCs\n\n\n### Hilton Worldwide\n\n\n\n*   Founded in 1919 by Conrad Hilton\n*   Has over **4600 hotels** in **100 countries** worldwide\n*   Largest hotel chain in the world with over **750000 rooms**\n*   Sponsor of US Olympic team since 2005\n*   Credited with the development of the first airport hotel in San Francisco in 1949\n*   Number of brands including the Conrad Hotels, Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts\n*   Employs over **160000 people** worldwide\n\n\n### Thomas Cook Group\n\n\n\n*   Tourism TNC that has diversified\n*   Founded in 1841 as transport company for the UK\n*   Introduced “circular notes”, which became traveller's cheques\n*   Company also involved in military transport and postal service\n*   In the UK, Thomas Group became a “vertically integrated” company providing air transport, hotels, resorts, cruise lines, and tour operators\n*   Employs over **20000 people** worldwide\n*   Nearly **3000** **stores**, **97 aircraft**, and **20 million customers per year**\n*   Thomas Cook was a sponsor of the London 2012 Olympic Games\n\n\n## Case study: small island developing states, The Maldives\n\n\n\n*   Consists of 1,190 tiny islands, **200** of which are inhabited by the population of **300000**\n*   Tropical monsoon climate, hot and humid conditions, dry from October to April\n*   **400000** tourists visit annually\n\n\n### Economic importance\n\n\n\n*   Accents for 28% of the Maldives’ GDP and more than 60% of its foreign exchange\n*   Over 90% of the government tax comes from import duties\n*   Tourism has created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities, and the multiplier effect\n*   Fishing used to be the prime industry, but tourism has recently assumed a greater importance\n*   Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the economy, as they are constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor\n*   Industry , consisting of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts accounted for only 7% of the GDP in 2009\n*   Most staple foods must be imported\n\n\n### Vulnerability to external shocks\n\n\n\n*   Tourist demand and revenue grew rapidly between 1990 and 2009, at an annual rate of 5%, but the rate has fallen and is predicted to average 2% between 2010 and 2020\n*   The Maldives are vulnerable to external schosck of human and natural activity\n    *   Sea-level rise is a threat as the Maldives is only 1.5 m above sea-level; it is the lowest country on the planet\n        *   Sea-level has increased by around 20 cm since the 1990s\n    *   Tsunamis, as the Maldives are in a tectonically active zone\n        *   Badly affected by the Asian tsunami of December 2004, which left 100 dead and caused $300 M of property damage\n        *   This caused the GDP to contract by 4.6% in 2005, although reconstruction was rapid\n    *   The world economic recession of 2008 caused a stagnation for all sectors\n\n\n### Vulnerability to internal limitations\n\n\n#### Depletion of resources\n\n\n\n*   The average tourist consumes more water and energy than the average Maldivian\n*   Almost all water is produced by desalination, which is very expensive\n*   Groundwater supplies are running short and often contaminated by sewage or saltwater\n*   There are no economic minderson the Maldives, and the agricultural potential is low\n\n\n#### Pollution\n\n\n\n*   Solid and liquid waste production from tourists are high and matches their consumption\n*   Solid waste is either dumped in poorly managed landfill sites, incinerated or sunbed at sea, all three possessed being unsustainable\n\n\n### Respond to threats\n\n\n#### Environment\n\n\n\n*   New tourist

late February, and finishing in mid-May, thus creating a platform for young players who might otherwise not get a chance to play for a team</li>\n<li>This has also allowed people from disadvantaged backgrounds to play</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Most supporters are within the province, although many of the fanbase has moved for university/home, or marriage</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Case study: the Glastonbury rural Festival</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Glastonbury Festival</strong> is the largest open-air music festival in Europe, and is globally recognized</li>\n<li>It is <strong>cultural tourism</strong> that embraces many activities: visiting <strong>heritage sites, exploring historical and religious festivals, and attending music and fine arts drama

visited tourists venues in Ireland</li>\n<li>Over a million visitors travel to Kerry each year, bringing an estimated £160 M to the area</li>\n<li>Resident population of 14,000 with over 4.000 tourist rooms</li>\n<li>The scenic quality is made of a variety of physical and human landscapes including the three lakes of Killarney, secluded lake shores, limestone cliffs, rocks and islands, waterfalls and rapidly flowing rivers, rugged sandstone mountains, eroded valleys, native wood oaklands, and historical buildings and ruins</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>National park</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Killarney National Park is managed by the Office of Public WOrks (OPW) and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve by the UNESCO</li>\n<li>National Parks in Ireland are areas that exist to “<em>exist to conserve natural

research</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Management strategy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Killarney park does not comprise a self-contained ecological unit as it is influenced by changes and developments that take place in the surrounding areas</li>\n<li>There are four main zones\n<ul>\n<li>Natural zone: nature conservation is the primary objective</li>\n<li>Cultural zone: conservation of airworthy features resulting from human activities is the primary objective</li>\n<li>Intensive management zone: basic park objectives other than conservation are emphasized</li>\n<li>Resource restoration zone</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Control and eradication of the Rhododendron population is the biggest challenges\n<ul>\n<li>Up to 900 ha of the park’s 11,200 ha of

far</li>\n<li>The Ministry of Culture is thinking of limiting the day pass to three hours, and limiting the time spent at each point</li>\n<li>Currently, only <strong>400 people per day</strong> are allowed to climb <strong>Huayna Picchu</strong>, and there is a limit of <strong>500 daily permits</strong> for the <strong>Inca trail</strong></li>\n<li>There are plans for roads and cable cars to access Machu Picchu, apart from only the railways</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>New regulations have been put in place\n<ul>\n<li>Visitors need to be organized in groups of at most 20 people for easier management</li>\n<li>Guides will have to wear uniforms with clearly visible credentials</li>\n<li>Visitors are prevented from leaving an organized group and joining another</li>\n<li>Time limit of 3–5 minutes to stop and appreciate Machu Picchu’s significant and sacred points of interest inlucid the <strong>Intihuatana</strong>, and the <strong>Temple of the Condor</strong>, to prevent bottleneck traffic jams</li>\n<li>Signs that say “Keep Moving”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>However, tour operators are firmly against the new restrictions</li>\n<li>Since 2011, the daily average number of visitors

leisure\n*   The range of leisure activities is expanding rapidly with the development of societies to support enthusiasts\n*   Leisure time has grown because of a\n    *   Reaction in the length of the working day and week\n    *   Increase in wages\n    *   Increase in disposable income\n    *   Growth of leisure activities\n    *   More early retirement\n    *   Increase in self-employment or flexitime\n    *   Developments in technology (such as washing machines), giving people more time and opportunities for leisure\n*   Men usually have more leisure time than females due to household and parenting responsibilities, although this is changing\n*   LICs have less disposable income, and therefore a lower change in engaging in leisure activities\n*   As LE increases, pursuing leisure activities is more important as adults benefit from it physically, socially, emotionally, and culturally\n\n\n## Categorization of tourism and sports\n\n\n\n*   Primary tourist resources are the pre-existing attractions for tourism or recreation (climate, scenery, wildlife, indigenous people, cultural heritage sites)\n\n\n## Case study: changes in China’s leisure activities\n\n\n\n*   In 2015,\n    *   22% of people spend 1–2 hours/day on leisure activities\n    *   16% spend 3–4\n    *   12% spend 4–5%, the rest spend more than 5 hours\n*   About ⅓ of people spend their leisure time reading and ⅙ watching TV, partially because China is becoming more rich, and the middle classes are also growing\n*   There are various leisure activities\n    *   ⅓ of chinese adults spend time on the internet through mobile phone/laptop\n    *   Shopping is enjoyed by women mostly\n    *   Sports include table tennis and badminton: there are various free badminton courts in sporting clubs\n    *   Other activities include chess, cards, dancing, and jogging, in chinese parks\n*   An increasing amount of the middle class are taking part in leisure and sport\n    *   **33.9%** of the population between 7 and 70 exercise regularly and **60.7%** of the urban population go to sports clubs to engage in fitness activities\n*   However, many do not have time to engage in these activities\n    *   For example, migrants work long hours, and are tired (physically and mentally), so they do not taking part in sports and other leisure activities\n    *   They do not have much disposable income, and if they do, they send it to their family or abroad\n    *   Some do have free time, but spend it studying\n    *   In 2015, around **227 M** migrant workers were in the workforce\n*   Children's leisure activities are also changing\n    *   The most popular activities used to be homework, extra reading, and academic training programmes\n    *   After 1995, Saturday schools ceased, so leisure activities and vacations were more orgazies, and summer camps were started\n*   China's leisure activities are getting more similar to that of the Western world including USA\n    *   In 2016, the Wanda group opened **Wanda city** in **Nanchang**, which is rival to Disney world\n    *   In 2016, Disney also opened a resort in Shanghai, **Mickey Mao**, and is expected to become the world's most visited park with **50 M** guests/year\n\n\n## Cast study: sports participation in the UK\n\n\n\n*   Participation in sport is greater among younger people, those with a car, students, and those in higher income bands\n    *   Those most likely **not** to participate in sport include those aged over 67, black, minority, lone pensioners, local authority tenants, those with no qualifications, sick, and disabled\n    *   People who participate in sports as children are more likely to participate as adults\n*   The most popular sports vary by sex\n    *   Women:

and national scale\n\n\n## Case study: national sports league, Rugby in South Africa\n\n\n\n*   Rugby is one of SA’s biggest sports along with soccer and cricket\n*   The **Currie Cup**\n    *   The currie cup was the first rugby competition in SA in 1892\n    *   The format varies from year to year and the finals were held intermittently until 1968, after which the finals had become an annual event\n    *   Up to 2015, the most successfully province in the history of the Currie Cup was the Western province (Western Cape) with 33 titles, followed by the Blue Bulls with 23 titles\n    *   Sunce rugby become a professional sport in the early 1990s, no single team has dominated the cup\n    *   For many years, the biggest rivalry in South African rugby was between Western Province and the Blue Bulls\n        *   During the early to mid-1990s, there was a three-way rivalry between Natal, the Lions, and Western Province\n    *   The **Currie Cup** takes place yearly between July and October, with 14 teams\n*   The **Vodacom Cup**\n    *   The Vodacom Cup has become an important competitor on the SA rugby calendar\n    *   It takes place at the same time as the **Super 14** competition, starting in late February, and finishing in mid-May, thus creating a platform for young players who might otherwise not get a chance to play for a team\n    *   This has also allowed people from disadvantaged backgrounds to play\n*   Most supporters are within the province, although many of the fanbase has moved for university/home, or marriage\n\n\n## Case study: the Glastonbury rural Festival\n\n\n\n*   The **Glastonbury Festival** is the largest open-air music festival in Europe, and is globally recognized\n*   It is **cultural tourism** that embraces many activities: visiting **heritage sites, exploring historical and religious festivals, and attending music and fine arts drama festivals**\n*   Festival goers are attracted by the opportunity to see a particular type of performance or particular performer and to be a part of the festival cultures: this also presents an opportunity to socialize with friends\n\n\n### Development\n\n\n\n*   The festival began as the **Pilton Pop Festival** in 1970, and has been held every year, except for 2001 since its inauguration\n*   It is an open air festival which covers approximately 800 acres, and the site now accommodates 250,000 people\n\n\n### Impacts of the festival\n\n\n\n*   Economic impacts include\n    *   The Mendip local authority area, Shepton Mallet, Street and Wells, and their rural hinterland, Bristol and Bath, the South-West region, and the UK all benefit financially from the festival\n    *   Each visitor spends an average £293, and this income makes contributions to charities such as Water Aid, Greenpeace, and Oxfam\n        *   The money is also used to support local projects such as the provision of school and sporting facilities\n    *   However, there are a number of negative impacts too, such as drug, substance abuse, and theft, owing to the increasing amount of tourists\n*   Growth of Glastonbury\n    *   The festival is now welcomed by the local community as it is associated with rebellion and hippie culture\n    *   Civic pride is derived from hosting a global event\n    *   It offers local people an employment opportunity\n*   There are also various environmental impacts\n    *   Air pollution\n        *   CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increase dramatically during June on the 3-day festival\n        *   Car transport is popular due to its flexibility, although attempts to encourage supporters to use public transport are being made\n        *   Green coaches using environmentally acceptable fuels are also encouraged\n    *   Waste disposal\n        *   Waste creation is one of the biggest problems\n        *   Waste mainly consists of human waste, plastic bottles, and tents\n        *   Many tourists leave behind tents: ⅙ tents were left behind in 2006\n    *   Noise pollution\n        *   This causes a disturbance to the locals\n    *   Provision of resources\n        *   Energy, water, and food need to be supplied\n\n\n## Case study: Killarney National Park, Ireland\n\n\n\n*   The region relies heavily on tourism as a source of employment and revenue as the amount of paid holidays, disposable income, and transport infrastructure has increased, so the number of tourists visiting has also increased\n\n\n### Location\n\n\n\n*   One of the most visited tourists venues in Ireland\n*   Over a million visitors travel to Kerry each year, bringing an estimated £160 M to the area\n*   Resident population of 14,000 with over 4.000 tourist rooms\n*   The scenic quality is made of a variety of physical and human landscapes including the three lakes of Killarney, secluded lake shores, limestone cliffs, rocks and islands, waterfalls and rapidly flowing rivers, rugged sandstone mountains, eroded valleys, native wood oaklands, and historical buildings and ruins\n\n\n### National park\n\n\n\n*   The Killarney National Park is managed by the Office of Public WOrks (OPW) and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve by the UNESCO\n*   National Parks in Ireland are areas that exist to “_exist to conserve natural plant and animal communities and scenic landscapes which are both extensive and of national importance and, under conditions compatible with that purpose, to enable the public to visit and appreciate them_” \n*   The main objective of the National Park are to\n    *   Conserve nature and other significant features and qualities\n    *   Encourage public appreciation of the heritage and the need for conservation\n    *   Develop a harmonious relationship between the park and the community\n    *   Enable to park to contribute to science through environmental monitoring and research\n\n\n### Management strategy\n\n\n\n*   The Killarney park does not comprise a self-contained ecological unit as it is influenced by changes and developments that take place in the surrounding areas\n*   There are four main zones\n    *   Natural zone: nature conservation is the primary objective\n    *   Cultural zone: conservation of airworthy features resulting from human activities is the primary objective\n    *   Intensive management zone: basic park objectives other than conservation are emphasized\n    *   Resource restoration zone\n\n\n### Challenges\n\n\n\n*   Control and eradication of the Rhododendron population is the biggest challenges\n    *   Up to 900 ha of the park’s 11,200 ha of native woodland are infested\n\n\n# E.3 Tourism and sport at the international scale\n\n\n## Case study: Machu Picchu, a heritage tourism\n\n\n\n*   Machu Picchu was a center of worship\n*   It is a World Heritage Site and in 2007, was selected as one of the New7Wonders of the work\n*   It is one of the most attractive cultural sites in Latin America to tourists all around the world\n*   However, there are many problems in managing tourism pressures\n    *   UNESCO authorities are worried about **deforestation**, the risk of **landslides**, uncontrolled **urban development**, and illegal access to the sanctuary\n    *   UNESCO has considered adding the site to the endangered list, but has not so far\n    *   The Ministry of Culture is thinking of limiting the day pass to three hours, and limiting the time spent at each point\n    *   Currently, only **400 people per day** are allowed to climb **Huayna Picchu**, and there is a limit of **500 daily permits** for the **Inca trail**\n    *   There are plans for roads and cable cars to access Machu Picchu, apart from only the railways\n*   New regulations have been put in place\n    *   Visitors need to be organized in groups of at most 20 people for easier management\n    *   Guides will have to wear uniforms with clearly visible credentials\n    *   Visitors are prevented from leaving an organized group and joining another\n    *   Time limit of 3–5 minutes to stop and appreciate Machu Picchu’s significant and sacred points of interest inlucid the **Intihuatana**, and the **Temple of the Condor**, to prevent bottleneck traffic jams\n    *   Signs that say “Keep Moving”\n*   However, tour operators are firmly against the new restrictions\n*   Since 2011, the daily average number of visitors at Machu Picchu has far exceeded the daily limit of 2,500 as agreed to by Peru and the UNESCO\n\n\n## Case study: role of TNCs\n\n\n### Hilton Worldwide\n\n\n\n*   Founded in 1919 by Conrad Hilton\n*   Has over **4600 hotels** in **100 countries** worldwide\n*   Largest hotel chain in the world with over **750000 rooms**\n*   Sponsor of US Olympic team since 2005\n*   Credited with the development of the first airport hotel in San Francisco in 1949\n*   Number of brands including the Conrad Hotels, Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts\n*   Employs over **160000 people** worldwide\n\n\n### Thomas Cook Group\n\n\n\n*   Tourism TNC that has diversified\n*   Founded in 1841 as transport company for the UK\n*   Introduced “circular notes”, which became traveller's cheques\n*   Company also involved in military transport and postal service\n*   In the UK, Thomas Group became a “vertically integrated” company providing air transport, hotels, resorts, cruise lines, and tour operators\n*   Employs over **20000 people** worldwide\n*   Nearly **3000** **stores**, **97 aircraft**, and **20 million customers per year**\n*   Thomas Cook was a sponsor of the London 2012 Olympic Games\n\n\n## Case study: small island developing states, The Maldives\n\n\n\n*   Consists of 1,190 tiny islands, **200** of which are inhabited by the population of **300000**\n*   Tropical monsoon climate, hot and humid conditions, dry from October to April\n*   **400000** tourists visit annually\n\n\n### Economic importance\n\n\n\n*   Accents for 28% of the Maldives’ GDP and more than 60% of its foreign exchange\n*   Over 90% of the government tax comes from import duties\n*   Tourism has created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities, and the multiplier effect\n*   Fishing used to be the prime industry, but tourism has recently assumed a greater importance\n*   Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the economy, as they are constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor\n*   Industry , consisting of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts accounted for only 7% of the GDP in 2009\n*   Most staple foods must be imported\n\n\n### Vulnerability to external shocks\n\n\n\n*   Tourist demand and revenue grew rapidly between 1990 and 2009, at an annual rate of 5%, but the rate has fallen and is predicted to average 2% between 2010 and 2020\n*   The Maldives are vulnerable to external schosck of human and natural activity\n    *   Sea-level rise is a threat as the Maldives is only 1.5 m above sea-level; it is the lowest country on the planet\n        *   Sea-level has increased by around 20 cm since the 1990s\n    *   Tsunamis, as the Maldives are in a tectonically active zone\n        *   Badly affected by the Asian tsunami of December 2004, which left 100 dead and caused $300 M of property damage\n        *   This caused the GDP to contract by 4.6% in 2005, although reconstruction was rapid\n    *   The world economic recession of 2008 caused a stagnation for all sectors\n\n\n### Vulnerability to internal limitations\n\n\n#### Depletion of resources\n\n\n\n*   The average tourist consumes more water and energy than the average Maldivian\n*   Almost all water is produced by desalination, which is very expensive\n*   Groundwater supplies are running short and often contaminated by sewage or saltwater\n*   There are no economic minderson the Maldives, and the agricultural potential is low\n\n\n#### Pollution\n\n\n\n*   Solid and liquid waste production from tourists are high and matches their consumption\n*   Solid waste is either dumped in poorly managed landfill sites, incinerated or sunbed at sea, all three possessed being unsustainable\n\n\n### Respond to threats\n\n\n#### Environment\n\n\n\n*   New tourist sites must undergo an environmental impact assessment to measure potential construction to carrying capacity for the area, and developers must produce a mitigation plan\n*   To combat poor waste management, incinerators have been installed\n    *   Sewage disposal through soak-pits into aquifers is discouraged, and all new resort developments must now have their own waste-water treatment plants\n    *   The installation of desalination plants has substantially reduced the stress on the natural aquifer\n\n\n#### Economy\n\n\n\n*   The Maldivian government aims to diversify the economy beyond tourism and fishing, and encourage linkage between tourism and other sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and transport\n*   Some aims include reforming the public finance, encouraging foreign investment in the development of new resorts, broadening the tourism market by promoting domestic tourism and attracting visitors from China and India\n*   The goal is to increase employment, which is problematic given the limited resource base of the Maldives\n\n\n## Cast study: London 2012 Olympic Games\n\n\n\n*   They were held in London, and considered a great success\n    *   Helped regereate the poorest areas and derelict land\n    *   Created **12000** new jobs\n        *   More than **46000** people worked in the Olympic Park and Village, **10%** of whom were previously unemployed\n    *   **£17 B** spend on upgrading infrastructure\n    *   **2800** new homes built\n    *   Lead to a **1.2%** reduction in unemployment levels\n*   Helped improve infrastructure for the **locals**\n    *   The Games encouraged developments in the Eastend of London, such as Westfield shopping center, employing people in the process\n    *   Women and black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people found employment in construction jobs\n        *   The “Women into Construction” project funded by the London Development Agency and constructions schools recruited and placed 266 women directly with Olympic Park contractors\n*   There were **government investments** too\n    *   The UK government invested **£30 M** to transform the Olympic site into the “Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park”, which includes housing, new schools, health centers, business space, and sports avenues\n    *   This involved converting the Olympic Village into more than **2800** flats with additional new neighborhoods containing **11000** residents, ⅓ which were affordable housing\n    *   **Transport for London** invested **£6.5 M** in transport infrastructure in preparation for the 2012 games\n*   The main aims of the Games were:\n    *   To regenerate and transform London’s poorest areas (East End, Westfield)\n    *   To create a Games for the world, reflecting on London’s diversity\n    *   To create a legacy for east London "},html:{writable:!0,enumerable:!0,value:"<h1>E.1 Changing

center of worship</li>\n<li>It is a World Heritage Site and in 2007, was selected as one of the New7Wonders of the work</li>\n<li>It is one of the most attractive cultural sites in Latin America to tourists all around the world</li>\n<li>However, there are many problems in managing tourism pressures\n<ul>\n<li>UNESCO authorities are worried about <strong>deforestation</strong>, the risk of <strong>landslides</strong>, uncontrolled <strong>urban development</strong>, and illegal access to the sanctuary</li>\n<li>UNESCO has considered adding the site to the endangered list, but has not so far</li>\n<li>The Ministry of Culture is thinking of limiting the day pass to three hours, and limiting the time spent at each point</li>\n<li>Currently, only <strong>400 people per day</strong> are allowed to climb <strong>Huayna Picchu</strong>, and there is a limit of <strong>500 daily permits</strong> for the <strong>Inca trail</strong></li>\n<li>There are plans for roads and cable cars to access Machu Picchu, apart from only the railways</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>New regulations have been put in place\n<ul>\n<li>Visitors need to be organized in groups of at most 20 people for easier management</li>\n<li>Guides will have to wear uniforms with clearly visible credentials</li>\n<li>Visitors are prevented from leaving an organized group and joining another</li>\n<li>Time limit of 3–5 minutes to stop and appreciate Machu Picchu’s significant and sacred points of interest inlucid the <strong>Intihuatana</strong>, and the <strong>Temple of the Condor</strong>, to prevent bottleneck traffic jams</li>\n<li>Signs that say “Keep Moving”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>However, tour operators are firmly against the new restrictions</li>\n<li>Since 2011, the daily average number of visitors at Machu Picchu has far exceeded the daily limit of 2,500 as agreed to by Peru and the UNESCO</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Case study: role of TNCs</h2>\n<h3>Hilton Worldwide</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Founded in 1919 by

April</li>\n<li><strong>400000</strong> tourists visit annually</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Economic importance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accents for 28% of the Maldives’ GDP and more than 60% of its foreign exchange</li>\n<li>Over 90% of the government tax comes from import duties</li>\n<li>Tourism has created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities, and the multiplier effect</li>\n<li>Fishing used to be the prime industry, but tourism has recently assumed a greater importance</li>\n<li>Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the economy, as they are constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor</li>\n<li>Industry , consisting of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts accounted for only 7% of the GDP in 2009</li>\n<li>Most staple foods must be imported</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Vulnerability to external shocks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tourist demand and revenue grew rapidly between 1990 and 2009, at an annual rate of 5%, but the rate has fallen and is predicted to average 2% between 2010 and 2020</li>\n<li>The Maldives are vulnerable to external schosck of human and natural activity\n<ul>\n<li>Sea-level rise is a threat as the Maldives is only 1.5 m above sea-level; it is the lowest country on the planet\n<ul>\n<li>Sea-level has increased by around 20 cm since the 1990s</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tsunamis, as the Maldives are in a tectonically active zone\n<ul>\n<li>Badly affected by the Asian tsunami of December 2004, which left 100 dead and caused $300 M of

sectors</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Vulnerability to internal limitations</h3>\n<h4>Depletion of resources</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The average tourist consumes more water and energy than the average Maldivian</li>\n<li>Almost all water is produced by desalination, which is very expensive</li>\n<li>Groundwater supplies are running short and often contaminated by sewage or saltwater</li>\n<li>There are no economic minderson the Maldives, and the agricultural potential is low</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Pollution</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Solid and liquid waste production from tourists are high and matches their consumption</li>\n<li>Solid waste is either dumped in poorly managed landfill sites, incinerated or sunbed at sea, all three possessed being unsustainable</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Respond to threats</h3>\n<h4>Environment</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New tourist sites must undergo an environmental impact assessment to measure potential construction to carrying capacity for the area, and developers must produce a mitigation plan</li>\n<li>To combat poor waste management, incinerators have been installed\n<ul>\n<li>Sewage disposal through soak-pits into aquifers is discouraged, and all new resort developments must now have their own waste-water treatment plants</li>\n<li>The installation of desalination plants has substantially reduced the stress on the natural aquifer</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Economy</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Maldivian government aims to diversify the economy beyond tourism and fishing, and encourage linkage between tourism and other sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and transport</li>\n<li>Some aims include reforming the public finance, encouraging foreign investment in the development of new resorts, broadening the tourism market by promoting domestic tourism and attracting visitors from China and India</li>\n<li>The goal is to increase employment, which is problematic given the limited resource base of the Maldives</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cast study: London 2012 Olympic Games</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>They were held in London, and considered a great success\n<ul>\n<li>Helped regereate the poorest areas and derelict
