<h2>Poverty reduction and the global middle class</h2>
<ul>
<li>Poverty reduction was a goal of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) between <strong>2000 and 2015</strong>, and was a success:
<ul>
<li>1990: 50% of people in LICs lived on less than $1.25</li>
<li>2015: only 14%</li>
<li>The number of people living in extreme poverty fell from 1.9 B in 1990 to 836 M in 2015</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the same time, the number of people in the middle class tripled between <strong>1990 and 2015</strong> (people living on at leat $4/day)
<ul>
<li>This is because of the increase in average incomes and the fall in the number of people living in absolute poverty</li>
<li>Thi is a good economic feature as it helps increase the sales of goods such as phones, cars, electronic goods: the sales of cars increased by over <strong>800%</strong> since 2009</li>
<li>However, in the 1980s Brazil the middle class accounted for less than 30% of the population since the 1960s, unlike South Korea, where the middle class accounted for 50%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hover, not all the middle class has <strong>economic security</strong> as many people on incomes of over $4/day remain vulnerable to un(der)employment
<ul>
<li><strong>800 M people</strong> still live in extreme poverty including workers, living in unsafe conditions</li>
<li>People are also disadvantages on accounts of race and gender: in Latin America, women are more likely to live in poverty than men
<ul>
<li>The proportion has increased from 108 women to 100 men in 1997 to 117 women to 100 men in 2012</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Globally, <strong>75%</strong> of men are part of global labor force, but only <strong>50%</strong> of women are, and women earn on average <strong>25%</strong> less than men</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Global consumption of resources</h2>
<h3>Ecological footprints</h3>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>ecological footprint</strong> is the hypothetical area of land required by a society, group, or individual to fulfill all their resource needs and assimilate their wastes</li>
<li>A country <strong>increases</strong> the ecological footprint through
<ul>
<li>Relying on fossil fuels</li>
<li>Higher levels of imported resources (higher transport)</li>
<li>Meat-rich diets</li>
<li>High technology and energy use</li>
<li>Large population</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A country <strong>reduces</strong> the ecological footprint through
<ul>
<li>Reducing the amount of resources used</li>
<li>Recycling and reusing</li>
<li>Improving resource use and efficiency</li>
<li>Improve technology to increase carrying capacity</li>
<li>Technology to improve and increase land use</li>
<li>Reducing population (anti-natalist policies)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ecological footprints in HICs and LICs</h3>
<ul>
<li>HICs, in general, have higher disposable incomes which means that consumption and demand for energy resources are high, and their resource use is more wasteful
<ul>
<li>Meat-eating diets are more prevalent in HICs, where <strong>30%</strong> of the diet is based off of animal protein
<ul>
<li>Meat-eating diets in general use more land than the vegetarian diet as animals use <strong>90%</strong> of the for they eat for other processes such as respiration</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People in LICs, by contrast, have less to spend
<ul>
<li>Resources are often recycled through the informal economy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GHG emissions from agriculture also affect the total footprint
<ul>
<li>According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the agriculture sector emist between 5.1 and 6.1 B tonnes of GHG annually, about <strong>11%</strong> of the total GHG emissions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Populations more <strong>dependent on fossil fuels</strong> have higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Patterns and trends in water availability and consumption</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embedded/virtual water</strong> refers to the way in which water is transferred from one country to another through its exports</li>
<li>Water is unevenly distributed: about <strong>780 M</strong> people do not have access to clean water, and this number will increase in 2015, when the world population will likely reach around <strong>9 B</strong></li>
<li>HICs maintain or increase their consumption of resources such as water, although an increasing portion of this water is embedded in agricultural and manufactured products</li>
<li>Land grabs and transfer lead to loss of water
<ul>
<li><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> cut production of cerails at home by <strong>12%</strong>, and with a series of land grabs, produced the cereals it needed in parts of Africa</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Various trends <strong>increase</strong> the pressure on water
<ul>
<li>Population growth, expected to reach **9 B **by <strong>2050</strong></li>
<li>Growing middle class: increasing affluence leads to greater water consumption (showers, baths, gardening)</li>
<li>Growth of <strong>tourism</strong> and recreation (golf courses, water parks, pools)</li>
<li>Urbanization: urban areas require significant water investment to get water to people and to remove waste products hygienically</li>
<li>Climate change</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Patterns and trends in the availability of land and food consumption</h2>
<ul>
<li>The food intake has <strong>increased</strong> in mainly the NICs, and is <strong>constant</strong> in LICs such as countries in Southern Africa</li>
<li>HICs are adopting a more varied diet including meats</li>
<li>The fast-food industry is growing in HICs and LICs as their demand increases
<ul>
<li>Food demand is inelastic as a person’s food consumption only increases up to a certain point</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since 1961, the total fish supply and consumption increases by about 3.6% per year while the world’s population has grown by 1.8% over the same period
<ul>
<li>Production from the world’s ocean fisheries has levelled off since the 1970s, largely because of overfishing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Growth rates of food production and crop yields have been falling
<ul>
<li>This can be due to natural hazards (fires, floods, draughts), climate change, and use of land to produce biofuels</li>
<li>Food shortages also lead to riots in Indonesia, Egypt, and North Africa</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ways of increasing crop production:
<ul>
<li>Expanding the area farmed</li>
<li>Multicropping, often using irrigation</li>
<li>Using high-yielding varieties or genetically modified organisms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Patterns and trends in availability and consumption of energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Energy insecurity has risen for a number of reasons
<ul>
<li>Increased demand, especially from NICs</li>
<li>Decreased reserves as supplies are used up</li>
<li>Global warming and natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina (2005) increased awareness of the misuse of energy resources</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A diversified energy mix offers the most energy security</li>
<li>The Middle East controls 50% of the world’s remaining oil reserves and Saudi Arabia controls 20%
<ul>
<li>USA consumes 200 M barrels/day but possess less than 2% of the world’s oil reserves, so it has to source much of its oil from overseas, notably the middle east</li>
<li>This gives the Middle East economic and political advantage, and countries that want oil have to stay on friendly terms with them</li>
<li>Countries that depend on their region for oil need to
<ul>
<li>Ensure political stability of the Middle East</li>
<li>Maintain good political links with the Middle East</li>
<li>Involve the Middle East in economic cooperation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>3.2 Impacts of changing trends in resource consumption</h1>
<p>[Never completed this]</p>
<h2>Case study: resource security in the Hindu Kush region</h2>
<ul>
<li>South Asia has 3% of the world’s land, but around 25% of the world’s population</li>
<li>Food, emgy, and water security are therefore important, however, around 20% of the population lack access to safe drinking water</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nexus</h3>
<ul>
<li>The nexus approach to food, water, and energy is an integrated method for achieving security in all three elements</li>
<li>The ecosystem services provided by the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH( region are vital for the security of all three sectors (1.3 B people rely on water from the HKH region)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rapid population growth, rapid urbanization, industrialization, uncertainties of climate change</li>
<li>Thee changes lead to increased demand and pressure on resources</li>
</ul>
