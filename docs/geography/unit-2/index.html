<h2>Structure of the Earth</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thermosphere</li>
<li>Atmosphere</li>
<li>Stratosphere</li>
<li>Troposphere</li>
</ul>
<h3>Atmospheric energy balance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insolation</strong> is incoming solar radiation</li>
<li>Most of this energy in the tropical regions, whereas there is a loss in energy from poles</li>
<li>There is a redistribution of energy from lower altitudes to higher latitudes by wind circulation and ocean currents</li>
<li>Only 46% of energy is absorbed at the surface</li>
</ul>
<h3>Atmospheric energy balance</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are three types of heat transfer
<ul>
<li>Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves</li>
<li>Convection is the transfer of heat by movement of gas or liquid</li>
<li>Conduction is the transfer of heat by contact</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Of <strong>46%</strong> of the insolation reaches the earth's atmosphere</li>
<li>Reflection from the earth's surface is known as <strong>planetary albedo</strong></li>
<li>Energy received from the Sun by the Earth is re-radiate at a long wavelength</li>
</ul>
<h3>Incoming (short-wave) radiation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insolation</strong> is the main energy out, and it affected by latitude, season, and cloud cover
<ul>
<li>The less cloud cover, the more radiation reaches the Earth’s surface</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Short-wave radiation is not absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, they only heat up the Earth, which then predicted long-wave radiation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Long-wave radiation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-wave radiation</strong> refers to the radiation of energy from the Earth (cold body) into the atmosphere</li>
<li>During the day, outgoing long-wave radiation transfer is greater than the incoming long-wave transfer, so there is a net loss of energy</li>
<li>On a cloudy night, clouds return some long-wave radiation to the surface, which reduced the overall loss of energy</li>
</ul>
<h2>The greenhouse effect</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>greenhouse effect</strong> is the process by which certain gases allow short-wave radiation from the Sun to pass through the atmosphere but trap an increasing proportion of outgoing long-wave radiation from the Earth</li>
</ul>
<h3>Greenhouse gases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Water vapour: accounts for 50% of the greenhouse effect</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide: from deforestation, as it removed tres that convert carbon dioxide to oxygen</li>
<li>Methane: from cattle, wetlands</li>
<li>Chlorofluorocarbons: destroy ozone</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in the global energy balance</h2>
<h3>Variations in solar radiation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changes in the output of energy from the sun (11-year cycle)</li>
<li>Small variations in the Earth's orbit affect the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation (responsible for ice ages)</li>
<li>Changes in atmospheric composition are linked to an increase in global temperature</li>
<li>Changes in <strong>albedo</strong>, as the ice melts and is replaced by darker vegetation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global dimming</h3>
<ul>
<li>Air pollution has a cooling effect</li>
<li>Natural particles in clean air provide condensation nuclei for water, and polluted air contains more particles than clean air, and therefore many more states for water to bind to</li>
<li>The droplets are smaller than natural ones, meaning polluted clouds conant smaller water droplets, and hence reflect more sunlight, presenting the Sun’s heat from getting through the Earth's surface</li>
</ul>
<h3>Feedback loops</h3>
<ol>
<li>Positive feedback
<ul>
<li>Ice caps
<ul>
<li>Melting of polar ice caps = lower albedo</li>
<li>Less ice = less reflection of radiation</li>
<li>So more energy absorbed, hence an increase in temperature</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Melting ice and water
<ul>
<li>Melt Ice ice = more water = bigger waves</li>
<li>Larger waves break up sea ice</li>
<li>Water is less reflective, so more energy absorbed, hence an increase in temperature</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Permafrost
<ul>
<li>Thawing of permafrost = increase in methane levels</li>
<li>Adding to the GHGs</li>
<li>So increase in temperature because heat is prevented from leaving</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Negative feedback
<ul>
<li>Burning, leading to more aerosols, and reduced solar radiation, causing cooling (global dimming)</li>
<li>Increased evaporation, leading to more cooling</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Case study: negative feedback in Greenland</p>
<h2>Enhanced greenhouse effect</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>enhanced greenhouse effect</strong> is the impact of increasing levels of greenhouse gases as a result of human activities, often referred to as <strong>global warming</strong></li>
<li>The increase in the world's greenhouse gases is linked to industrialization, trade, and globalization</li>
</ul>
<h1>Consequences of global climate change</h1>
<h2>Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sea-level rise: floods to low-lying areas such as the Maldives, and Bangladesh</li>
<li>Storm activity increase</li>
<li>Agricultural patterns change: USA’s grain belt will shrink and production will decline, while Canada's goriing season will get longer and more productive</li>
<li>Less rainfall over the USA, southern Europe, and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)</li>
<li>Up to <strong>40%</strong> of wildlife species will go extinct in the Amazon, Miombo woodlands of South Africa (African elephants, sundarban tigers, and also sea-animals such as sharks)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hydrosphere</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rise in sea-levels flooding low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, Netherlands, Egypt, displacing over 200 million people
<ul>
<li>Water expands in heat, leading to a higher increase in sea-level, of from 40–80 cm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Floods from melting glaciers treating over 4 M km<sup>2</sup> of land</li>
</ul>
<h3>Case study: climate change impacts on the UK</h3>
<ul>
<li>Temperature rise of 1.5–4.5ºC</li>
<li>Sea-level rise by 20–40 cm (around 3 mm per year, as predicted by the government)</li>
<li>Trees: deciduous trees would replace conifers</li>
<li>Plants: crocuses and daffodils would only grow in the north; maize will only grow in the south</li>
<li>Birds: Arctic species such as Snow bunting and Dotterel will face extinction; Greenshank and Dunlin under threat</li>
<li>Flooding defences to be rebuilt in low-lying areas: Kent, East Angelica</li>
<li>More heat waves, like those in 2003, which killed over 2000 people in the UK: they are expected to become the norm by the 2040s</li>
<li>Vector-borne diseases: more risks from new and emerging pests and diseases
<ul>
<li>The higher temperatures extends the range of certain insects and pests</li>
<li>Milder, lower temperature, winters also increase the survival rate of these pests</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes in sea ice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Melting season of Arctic increase</li>
<li>As sea ice recedes, potential for wave formation reduces</li>
<li>Larger waves help break up sea ice, establishing positive feedback of disappearing sea ice and wave formation
<ul>
<li>In 2012, a 5-meter wave was recorded in the Beaufort Sea</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Methane emissions from tundra will increase because</li>
<li>Polar bears have less time to hunt seal, and must spend more time on land
<ul>
<li>There is also a reduced body size, and decreased reproductive success</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Glaciers and ice caps</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Himalayan glaciers are retreating
<ul>
<li>This may have a major impact on the region’s water supply (the Hindu Kush Himalayan region; glacier treatment could water shortages for up to 1.5 B people)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combined with other factors such as population growth and high density of population, this issue is made worse</li>
</ul>
<h3>Case study: retreat of Swiss glaciers</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Swiss Alps declined from 1,800 km<sup>2</sup> in 1850 to 1,300 km<sup>2</sup> in 1972, a loss of ⅓ of the surface area</li>
<li>The glacier changed substantially between 1882 and 2015
<ul>
<li>In 1882, it was 15 km long</li>
<li>Between 1883 and 1885, it grew slowly, around 4 km; it remained steady for a few years</li>
<li>It then repeated 26 m/yr for the next couple of years</li>
<li>By 1920, it was retreating 10 m/yr</li>
<li>Annual rates increase  in the 1920s</li>
<li>In 2007–8, it retreated drastically, a total of 290 m</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It has retreated over 2.5 km over the last 130 years due to global warming</li>
<li>Problems include
<ul>
<li>Economic: loss of homes and tourism (tourist guides and ski hotels lose tourists and hence income)</li>
<li>Social: less tourists arrive, tribes and displaced people must migrate</li>
<li>Environmental: loss of habitat and biomes as the alps receded for animals such as the Alpine ibex and Chamois</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in carbon stored in ice, oceans, and biosphere</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before the industrial revolution, the amount of ice stored on land, in oceans, and in the biosphere was balanced, but human activity has tipped the balance</li>
<li>Before the industrial revolution, the carbon concentration would only change through
<ul>
<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>
<li>Sea-floor spreading</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the 1990s, human activity added 8.0 PgC, 6.4 of which acme from burning fossil fuels
<ul>
<li>The oceans absorbed 28% and the land 32%, the rest remaining in the atmosphere</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But in 2000–8, human activity added 9.1 PgC to the atmosphere annually, 7.7 PgC from fossil fuels and 1.4 PgC from deforestation and land -use change</li>
</ul>
<h3>Oceans</h3>
<ul>
<li>More carbon increases warms the atmosphere and makes plants grow faster and store more carbon</li>
<li>An increased carbon in the atmosphere has lead to more dissolving in the oceans
<ul>
<li>This endangers much marine life, especially shell-building animals as the acids dissolve and weaken the shells (weaken the carbonates of crabs and lobsters, and they end up with thinner shells)</li>
<li>The pH of water has dropped by 0.1 since 1750</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Warmer oceans decrease the abundance of phytoplankton, which grow more vigorously in cool, nutrient-rich waters such</li>
</ul>
<h3>Biosphere</h3>
<ul>
<li>With the doubling carbon dioxide, plant growth increases by 12–76%</li>
<li>Many forests are cleared for agricultural zones
<ul>
<li>However, if farmland is abandoned, such as in <strong>Montserrat</strong>, the vegetation ma revert to forest</li>
<li>By preventing wildfires, humans prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere, and instead it builds up in plants
<ul>
<li>Therefore, the use of fire to create new farmland releases considerable amounts of carbon into the atmosphere</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Permafrost contain large deposits of carbon, accumulate over thousands of years</li>
<li>The low temperature reduces the rate of decomposition of organic plant matter, leading an accumulation of dead organic matter</li>
<li>Warming of the peric glacier environments will lead to increased methane emissions</li>
<li>Decreases show reduced reflectivity of the surface, increasing the absorption of solar radiation (positive feedback)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in biomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Low-lying biomes such sa <strong>mangroves</strong> may be lost as a result of changes in sea level</li>
<li>Climate change in the past has happened over long periods of time, allowing animals to adapt gradually to new conditions
<ul>
<li>Current increases in temperature are happening very rapidly, so there is less time for organisms to adapt</li>
<li>Organisms will either have to migrate or go extinct if they’re unable to adapt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes to agriculture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Northward shift of wheat-growing in North America</li>
<li>More difficult to irrigate fields due to limited water resources</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact of climate change on people and places</h2>
<ul>
<li>Organisms-based diseases such as malaria: new hotter conditions are better for mosquitoes to breed</li>
<li>Migration due to changes in sea-level causes environmental-refugees</li>
<li>Changes in tourism
<ul>
<li>Extended summers, which o=is good for coastal resorts in North America</li>
<li>Winter sports stopped due to lack of snow (in Aviemore, an in the Alps)</li>
<li>Reduced precipitation makes some locations economic due to water shortage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hunger and conflict</li>
</ul>
<h1>Responding to climate change</h1>
<h2>Disparities in exposure</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exposure</strong> is the degree to which people are exposed to climate change</li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity</strong> is the degree to which people could be harmed by exposure to climate change</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive capacity</strong> is the degree to which they could mitigate the potential harm by taking action to reduce their exposure or sensitivity</li>
<li>Certain <strong>populations</strong> are more <strong>vulnerable</strong> than others: the very young, elderly, disabled, poor, minority groups, refugees, and indigenous people</li>
<li>Certain <strong>locations</strong> are more <strong>vulnerable</strong> than others: low-lying islands, river mouths, valleys, coastal areas, regions deriving water supplies from mountain glaciers; therefore they face
<ul>
<li>Increased coastal erosion</li>
<li>Saline intrusion into groundwater supplies</li>
<li>Deterioration of coral reefs</li>
<li>Out-migration of people</li>
<li>Loss of income due to a decline in economic activities and infrastructure</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Case study: Flooding in Bangladesh</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most of Bangladesh lives along a delta formed by <strong>three rivers</strong> (<strong>the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra</strong>), which periodically flood the land
<ul>
<li>This is essential as it naturally irrigate the crops and increases soil fertility</li>
<li>However, since 1970, the scale, impact, and duration of these floods has increased, and there are still scientific prediction that it will continue increasing</li>
<li>A rise in temperatures of <strong>2.6ºC</strong> will lead to widespread repeated flooding</li>
<li>Due to <strong>sea-level rise</strong>, the densely populated coastal zone of Bangladesh is also increasingly vulnerable to coastal floods</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The flood damage is worsening due to the increased intensity of extreme precipitation events and the <strong>14-40%</strong> increase in monsoon rainfalls by the 2030s
<ul>
<li>Since 1990, the frencuney of extreme precipitation has increased in Narayanpur island as normal floods have become more catastrophic
<ul>
<li>Fewer than 1% can reach medical help within 1 hour as there is no suitable transport for those living by the indian border</li>
<li>People often have to sell assets post a flood to buy food and equipment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Government and non-government organizations have been involved in reducing the impacts of flooding in Bangladesh
<ul>
<li>In 1988, after the most severe floodings of the 20th century, the government developed the <strong>Flood Action Plan</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sluice gates were built on a number of rivers, which provided protection from flooding by tidal waves and storm surges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5,700 km of embankments were also built</li>
<li>Neary 5,000 km of drainage channels were built</li>
<li>200 flood shelters on stilts for equation of people threatened by floods
<ul>
<li>Watch has brick toilets and septic tanks to reduce water contamination</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Impacts of the flood include
<ul>
<li>Personal security
<ul>
<li>Deaths from drowning, diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid</li>
<li>Loss of income</li>
<li>Loss or unavailability of fuelwood</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buildings and infrastructure
<ul>
<li>Tin-wall and mud houses washed away</li>
<li>Damage to temples, and factories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crops and animals
<ul>
<li>Loss of livestock</li>
<li>Grain shortages</li>
<li>Damage to vegetation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Case study: Vulnerability and adaptation in Ghana</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Ghana in West Africa, there are a number of adaptations include
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure development: building dams, levees, and seawalls</li>
<li>Ecosystem-based measures: preserving and restoring natural habitats such as mangrove swamps</li>
<li>Capacity development: education and to teach people new techniques and to empower people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are different impacts and adaptations in different zones
<ul>
<li>Northern Savanna
<ul>
<li>Increased morbidity and disease prevalence</li>
<li>Increased vulnerability of the poor</li>
<li>Increased out-mediation and loss of human capital</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forest
<ul>
<li>Decreased food security</li>
<li>Dry-ups of water bodies and underground water</li>
<li>Population pressure on land</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coastal Savanna
<ul>
<li>Decreased water availability and quality</li>
<li>Higher burden on women</li>
<li>Increased migration</li>
<li>Increased cholera</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Government-led action</h2>
<h3>The UN Framework Concentration on climate change (1992)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The objective was to prevent GHGs in the atmosphere to grow to dangerous levels</li>
<li>It went into effect in 1994, but failed</li>
<li>The <strong>Kyoto Protocol (1997)</strong> was the first major attempt to implement the treaty
<ul>
<li>HICs were required to cut carbon emissions by 20% by 2012 compared to the 1990 emissions</li>
<li>The US didn't sign while Canada and Australia did</li>
</ul>

Rise in sea-levels flooding low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, Netherlands, Egypt, displacing over 200 million people\n    *   Water expands in heat, leading to a higher increase in sea-level, of from 40–80 cm\n*   Floods from melting glaciers treating over 4 M km<sup>2</sup> of land\n\n\n### Case study: climate change impacts on the UK\n\n\n\n*   Temperature rise of 1.5–4.5ºC\n*   Sea-level rise by 20–40 cm (around 3 mm per year, as predicted by the government)\n*   Trees: deciduous trees would replace conifers\n*   Plants: crocuses and daffodils would only grow in the north; maize will only grow in the south\n*   Birds: Arctic species such as Snow bunting and Dotterel will face extinction; Greenshank and Dunlin under threat\n*   Flooding defences to be rebuilt in low-lying areas: Kent, East Angelica\n*   More heat waves, like those in 2003, which killed over 2000 people in the UK: they are expected to become the norm by the 2040s\n*   Vector-borne diseases: more risks from new and emerging pests and diseases\n    *   The higher temperatures extends the range of certain insects and pests\n    *   Milder, lower temperature, winters also increase the survival rate of these pests\n\n\n### Changes in sea ice\n\n\n\n*   Melting season of Arctic increase\n*   As sea ice recedes, potential for wave formation reduces\n*   Larger waves help break up sea ice, establishing positive feedback of disappearing sea ice and wave formation\n    *   In 2012, a 5-meter wave was recorded in the Beaufort Sea\n*   Methane emissions from tundra will increase because \n*   Polar bears have less time to hunt seal, and must spend more time on land\n    *   There is also a reduced body size, and decreased reproductive success\n\n\n### Glaciers and ice caps\n\n\n\n*   The Himalayan glaciers are retreating\n    *   This may have a major impact on the region’s water supply (the Hindu Kush Himalayan region; glacier treatment could water shortages for up to 1.5 B people)\n*   Combined with other factors such as population growth and high density of population, this issue is made worse\n\n\n### Case study: retreat of Swiss glaciers\n\n\n\n*   The Swiss Alps declined from 1,800 km<sup>2</sup> in 1850 to 1,300 km<sup>2</sup> in 1972, a loss of ⅓ of the surface area\n*   The glacier changed substantially between 1882 and 2015\n    *   In 1882, it was 15 km long\n    *   Between 1883 and 1885, it grew slowly, around 4 km; it remained steady for a few years\n    *   It then repeated 26 m/yr for the next couple of years\n    *   By 1920, it was retreating 10 m/yr\n    *   Annual rates increase  in the 1920s\n    *   In 2007–8, it retreated drastically, a total of 290 m\n*   It has retreated over 2.5 km over the last 130 years due to global warming\n*   Problems include\n    *   Economic: loss of homes and tourism (tourist guides and ski hotels lose tourists and hence income)\n    *   Social: less tourists arrive, tribes and displaced people must migrate\n    *   Environmental: loss of habitat and biomes as the alps receded for animals such as the Alpine ibex and Chamois\n\n\n## Changes in carbon stored in ice, oceans, and biosphere\n\n\n\n*   Before the industrial revolution, the amount of ice stored on land, in oceans, and in the biosphere was balanced, but human activity has tipped the balance\n*   Before the industrial revolution, the carbon concentration would only change through\n    *   Volcanic eruptions\n    *   Sea-floor spreading\n*   In the 1990s, human activity added 8.0 PgC, 6.4 of which acme from burning fossil fuels\n    *   The oceans absorbed 28% and the land 32%, the rest remaining in the atmosphere \n*   But in 2000–8, human activity added 9.1 PgC to the atmosphere annually, 7.7 PgC from fossil fuels and 1.4 PgC from deforestation and land -use change \n\n\n### Oceans\n\n\n\n*   More carbon increases warms the atmosphere and makes plants grow faster and store more carbon\n*   An increased carbon in the atmosphere has lead to more dissolving in the oceans\n    *   This endangers much marine life, especially shell-building animals as the acids dissolve and weaken the shells (weaken the carbonates of crabs and lobsters, and they end up with thinner shells)\n    *   The pH of water has dropped by 0.1 since 1750\n*   Warmer oceans decrease the abundance of phytoplankton, which grow more vigorously in cool, nutrient-rich waters such \n\n\n### Biosphere\n\n\n\n*   With the doubling carbon dioxide, plant growth increases by 12–76%\n*   Many forests are cleared for agricultural zones\n    *   However, if farmland is abandoned, such as in **Montserrat**, the vegetation ma revert to forest\n    *   By preventing wildfires, humans prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere, and instead it builds up in plants\n        *   Therefore, the use of fire to create new farmland releases considerable amounts of carbon into the atmosphere\n\n\n### Ice\n\n\n\n*   Permafrost contain large deposits of carbon, accumulate over thousands of years\n*   The low temperature reduces the rate of decomposition of organic plant matter, leading an accumulation of dead organic matter\n*   Warming of the peric glacier environments will lead to increased methane emissions\n*   Decreases show reduced reflectivity of the surface, increasing the absorption of solar radiation (positive feedback)\n\n\n## Changes in biomes\n\n\n\n*   Low-lying biomes such sa **mangroves** may be lost as a result of changes in sea level\n*   Climate change in the past has happened over long periods of time, allowing animals to adapt gradually to new conditions\n    *   Current increases in temperature are happening very rapidly, so there is less time for organisms to adapt\n    *   Organisms will either have to migrate or go extinct if they’re unable to adapt\n\n\n### Changes to agriculture\n\n\n\n*   Northward shift of wheat-growing in North America\n*   More difficult to irrigate fields due to limited water resources\n\n\n## Impact of climate change on people and places\n\n\n\n*   Organisms-based diseases such as malaria: new hotter conditions are better for mosquitoes to breed\n*   Migration due to changes in sea-level causes environmental-refugees\n*   Changes in tourism\n    *   Extended summers, which o=is good for coastal resorts in North America\n    *   Winter sports stopped due to lack of snow (in Aviemore, an in the Alps)\n    *   Reduced precipitation makes some locations economic due to water shortage\n\n\n### Social\n\n\n\n*   Hunger and conflict\n\n\n# Responding to climate change\n\n\n## Disparities in exposure\n\n\n\n*   **Exposure** is the degree to which people are exposed to climate change\n*   **Sensitivity** is the degree to which people could be harmed by exposure to climate change\n*   **Adaptive capacity** is the degree to which they could mitigate the potential harm by taking action to reduce their exposure or sensitivity\n*   Certain **populations** are more **vulnerable** than others: the very young, elderly, disabled, poor, minority groups, refugees, and indigenous people\n*   Certain **locations** are more **vulnerable** than others: low-lying islands, river mouths, valleys, coastal areas, regions deriving water supplies from mountain glaciers; therefore they face\n    *   Increased coastal erosion\n    *   Saline intrusion into groundwater supplies\n    *   Deterioration of coral reefs\n    *   Out-migration of people\n    *   Loss of income due to a decline in economic activities and infrastructure\n\n\n## Case study: Flooding in Bangladesh\n\n\n\n*   Most of Bangladesh lives along a delta formed by **three rivers** (**the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra**), which periodically flood the land\n    *   This is essential as it naturally irrigate the crops and increases soil fertility\n    *   However, since 1970, the scale, impact, and duration of these floods has increased, and there are still scientific prediction that it will continue increasing\n    *   A rise in temperatures of **2.6ºC** will lead to widespread repeated flooding\n    *   Due to **sea-level rise**, the densely populated coastal zone of Bangladesh is also increasingly vulnerable to coastal floods\n*   The flood damage is worsening due to the increased intensity of extreme precipitation events and the **14-40%** increase in monsoon rainfalls by the 2030s\n    *   Since 1990, the frencuney of extreme precipitation has increased in Narayanpur island as normal floods have become more catastrophic\n        *   Fewer than 1% can reach medical help within 1 hour as there is no suitable transport for those living by the indian border\n        *   People often have to sell assets post a flood to buy food and equipment\n*   Government and non-government organizations have been involved in reducing the impacts of flooding in Bangladesh\n    *   In 1988, after the most severe floodings of the 20th century, the government developed the **Flood Action Plan**\n        *   Sluice gates were built on a number of rivers, which provided protection from flooding by tidal waves and storm surges\n    *   5,700 km of embankments were also built\n    *   Neary 5,000 km of drainage channels were built\n    *   200 flood shelters on stilts for equation of people threatened by floods\n        *   Watch has brick toilets and septic tanks to reduce water contamination\n*   Impacts of the flood include\n    *   Personal security\n        *   Deaths from drowning, diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid\n        *   Loss of income\n        *   Loss or unavailability of fuelwood\n    *   Buildings and infrastructure\n        *   Tin-wall and mud houses washed away\n        *   Damage to temples, and factories\n    *   Crops and animals\n        *   Loss of livestock\n        *   Grain shortages\n        *   Damage to vegetation\n\n\n## Case study: Vulnerability and adaptation in Ghana\n\n\n\n*   In Ghana in West Africa, there are a number of adaptations include\n    *   Infrastructure development: building dams, levees, and seawalls\n    *   Ecosystem-based measures: preserving and restoring natural habitats such as mangrove swamps\n    *   Capacity development: education and to teach people new techniques and to empower people\n*   There are different impacts and adaptations in different zones\n    *   Northern Savanna\n        *   Increased morbidity and disease prevalence\n        *   Increased vulnerability of the poor\n        *   Increased out-mediation and loss of human capital\n    *   Forest\n        *   Decreased food security \n        *   Dry-ups of water bodies and underground water\n        *   Population pressure on land\n    *   Coastal Savanna\n        *   Decreased water availability and quality\n        *   Higher burden on women\n        *   Increased migration\n        *   Increased cholera\n\n\n## Government-led action\n\n\n### The UN Framework Concentration on climate change (1992)\n\n\n\n*   The objective was to prevent GHGs in the atmosphere to grow to dangerous levels\n*   It went into effect in 1994, but failed\n*   The **Kyoto Protocol (1997)** was the first major attempt to implement the treaty\n    *   HICs were required to cut carbon emissions by 20% by 2012 compared to the 1990 emissions\n    *   The US didn't sign while Canada and Australia did\n",html:"<h1>Causes of global climate change</h1>\n<h2>Structure of the

solar radiation</li>\n<li>Most of this energy in the tropical regions, whereas there is a loss in energy from poles</li>\n<li>There is a redistribution of energy from lower altitudes to higher latitudes by wind circulation and ocean currents</li>\n<li>Only 46% of energy is absorbed at the surface</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Atmospheric energy balance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>There are three types of heat transfer\n<ul>\n<li>Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves</li>\n<li>Convection is the transfer of heat by movement of gas or liquid</li>\n<li>Conduction is the transfer of heat by contact</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Of <strong>46%</strong> of the insolation reaches the earth's atmosphere</li>\n<li>Reflection from the earth's surface is known as <strong>planetary albedo</strong></li>\n<li>Energy received from the Sun by the Earth is re-radiate at a long wavelength</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Incoming (short-wave) radiation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insolation</strong> is the main energy out, and it affected by latitude, season, and cloud cover\n<ul>\n<li>The less cloud cover, the more radiation reaches the Earth’s surface</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Short-wave radiation is not absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, they only heat up the Earth, which then predicted long-wave radiation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Long-wave radiation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Long-wave radiation</strong> refers to the radiation of energy from the Earth (cold body) into the atmosphere</li>\n<li>During the day, outgoing long-wave radiation transfer is greater than the incoming long-wave transfer, so there is a net loss of energy</li>\n<li>On a cloudy night, clouds return some long-wave radiation to the surface, which reduced the overall loss of energy</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The greenhouse effect</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>greenhouse effect</strong> is the process by which certain gases allow short-wave radiation from the Sun to pass through the atmosphere but trap an increasing proportion of outgoing long-wave radiation from the Earth</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Greenhouse gases</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Water vapour: accounts for 50% of the greenhouse effect</li>\n<li>Carbon dioxide:

<strong>albedo</strong>, as the ice melts and is replaced by darker vegetation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Global dimming</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Air pollution has a cooling effect</li>\n<li>Natural particles in clean air provide condensation nuclei for water, and polluted air contains more particles than clean air, and therefore many more states for water to bind to</li>\n<li>The droplets are smaller than natural ones, meaning polluted clouds conant smaller water droplets, and hence reflect more sunlight, presenting the Sun’s heat from getting through the Earth's surface</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feedback

}]',component:{data:{},render:{},created:{}}}}},body:{writable:!0,enumerable:!0,value:"# Causes of global climate change\n\n\n## Structure of the Earth\n\n\n\n*   Thermosphere\n*   Atmosphere\n*   Stratosphere\n*   Troposphere\n\n\n### Atmospheric energy balance\n\n\n\n*   **Insolation** is incoming solar radiation\n*   Most of this energy in the tropical regions, whereas there is a loss in energy from poles\n*   There is a redistribution of energy from lower altitudes to higher latitudes by wind circulation and ocean currents\n*   Only 46% of energy is absorbed at the surface\n\n\n### Atmospheric energy balance\n\n\n\n*   There are three types of heat transfer\n    *   Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves\n    *   Convection is the transfer of heat by movement of gas or liquid\n    *   Conduction is the transfer of heat by contact\n*   Of **46%** of the insolation reaches the earth's atmosphere\n*   Reflection from the earth's surface is known as **planetary albedo** \n*   Energy received from the Sun by the Earth is re-radiate at a long wavelength\n\n\n### Incoming (short-wave) radiation\n\n\n\n*   **Insolation** is the main energy out, and it affected by latitude, season, and cloud cover\n    *   The less cloud cover, the more radiation reaches the Earth’s surface\n*   Short-wave radiation is not absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, they only heat up the Earth, which then predicted long-wave radiation\n\n\n### Long-wave radiation\n\n\n\n*   **Long-wave radiation** refers to the radiation of energy from the Earth (cold body) into the atmosphere\n*   During the day, outgoing long-wave radiation transfer is greater than the incoming long-wave transfer, so there is a net loss of energy\n*   On a cloudy night, clouds return some long-wave radiation to the surface, which reduced the overall loss of energy\n\n\n## The greenhouse effect\n\n\n\n*   The **greenhouse effect** is the process by which certain gases allow short-wave radiation from the Sun to pass through the atmosphere but trap an increasing proportion of outgoing long-wave radiation from the Earth\n\n\n### Greenhouse gases\n\n\n\n*   Water vapour: accounts for 50% of the greenhouse effect\n*   Carbon dioxide: from deforestation, as it removed tres that convert carbon dioxide to oxygen\n*   Methane: from cattle, wetlands\n*   Chlorofluorocarbons: destroy ozone\n\n\n## Changes in the global energy balance\n\n\n### Variations in solar radiation\n\n\n\n*   Changes in the output of energy from the sun (11-year cycle)\n*   Small variations in the Earth's orbit affect the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation (responsible for ice ages)\n*   Changes in atmospheric composition are linked to an increase in global temperature\n*   Changes in **albedo**, as the ice melts and is replaced by darker vegetation\n\n\n### Global dimming\n\n\n\n*   Air pollution has a cooling effect\n*   Natural particles in clean air provide condensation nuclei for water, and polluted air contains more particles than clean air, and therefore many more states for water to bind to\n*   The droplets are smaller than natural ones, meaning polluted clouds conant smaller water droplets, and hence reflect more sunlight, presenting the Sun’s heat from getting through the Earth's surface\n\n\n### Feedback loops\n\n\n\n1. Positive feedback\n    *   Ice caps\n        *   Melting of polar ice caps = lower albedo\n        *   Less ice = less reflection of radiation\n        *   So more energy absorbed, hence an increase in temperature\n    *   Melting ice and water\n        *   Melt Ice ice = more water = bigger waves\n        *   Larger waves break up sea ice\n        *   Water is less reflective, so more energy absorbed, hence an increase in temperature\n    *   Permafrost\n        *   Thawing of permafrost = increase in methane levels\n        *   Adding to the GHGs\n        *   So increase in temperature because heat is prevented from leaving\n2. Negative feedback\n    *   Burning, leading to more aerosols, and reduced solar radiation, causing cooling (global dimming)\n    *   Increased evaporation, leading to more cooling\n\nCase study: negative feedback in Greenland\n\n\n## Enhanced greenhouse effect\n\n\n\n*   The **enhanced greenhouse effect** is the impact of increasing levels of greenhouse gases as a result of human activities, often referred to as **global warming**\n*   The increase in the world's greenhouse gases is linked to industrialization, trade, and globalization\n\n\n# Consequences of global climate change\n\n\n## Implications\n\n\n\n*   Sea-level rise: floods to low-lying areas such as the Maldives, and Bangladesh\n*   Storm activity increase\n*   Agricultural patterns change: USA’s grain belt will shrink and production will decline, while Canada's goriing season will get longer and more productive\n*   Less rainfall over the USA, southern Europe, and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\n*   Up to **40%** of wildlife species will go extinct in the Amazon, Miombo woodlands of South Africa (African elephants, sundarban tigers, and also sea-animals such as sharks)\n\n\n### Hydrosphere\n\n\n\n*   Rise in sea-levels flooding low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, Netherlands, Egypt, displacing over 200 million people\n    *   Water expands in heat, leading to a higher increase in sea-level, of from 40–80 cm\n*   Floods from melting glaciers treating over 4 M km<sup>2</sup> of land\n\n\n### Case study: climate change impacts on the UK\n\n\n\n*   Temperature rise of 1.5–4.5ºC\n*   Sea-level rise by 20–40 cm (around 3 mm per year, as predicted by the government)\n*   Trees: deciduous trees would replace conifers\n*   Plants: crocuses and daffodils would only grow in the north; maize will only grow in the south\n*   Birds: Arctic species such as Snow bunting and Dotterel will face extinction; Greenshank and Dunlin under threat\n*   Flooding defences to be rebuilt in low-lying areas: Kent, East Angelica\n*   More heat waves, like those in 2003, which killed over 2000 people in the UK: they are expected to become the norm by the 2040s\n*   Vector-borne diseases: more risks from new and emerging pests and diseases\n    *   The higher temperatures extends the range of certain insects and pests\n    *   Milder, lower temperature, winters also increase the survival rate of these pests\n\n\n### Changes in sea ice\n\n\n\n*   Melting season of Arctic increase\n*   As sea ice recedes, potential for wave formation reduces\n*   Larger waves help break up sea ice, establishing positive feedback of disappearing sea ice and wave formation\n    *   In 2012, a 5-meter wave was recorded in the Beaufort Sea\n*   Methane emissions from tundra will increase because \n*   Polar bears have less time to hunt seal, and must spend more time on land\n    *   There is also a reduced body size, and decreased reproductive success\n\n\n### Glaciers and ice caps\n\n\n\n*   The Himalayan glaciers are retreating\n    *   This may have a major impact on the region’s water supply (the Hindu Kush Himalayan region; glacier treatment could water shortages for up to 1.5 B people)\n*   Combined with other factors such as population growth and high density of population, this issue is made worse\n\n\n### Case study: retreat of Swiss glaciers\n\n\n\n*   The Swiss Alps declined from 1,800 km<sup>2</sup> in 1850 to 1,300 km<sup>2</sup> in 1972, a loss of ⅓ of the surface area\n*   The glacier changed substantially between 1882 and 2015\n    *   In 1882, it was 15 km long\n    *   Between 1883 and 1885, it grew slowly, around 4 km; it remained steady for a few years\n    *   It then repeated 26 m/yr for the next couple of years\n    *   By 1920, it was retreating 10 m/yr\n    *   Annual rates increase  in the 1920s\n    *   In 2007–8, it retreated drastically, a total of 290 m\n*   It has retreated over 2.5 km over the last 130 years due to global warming\n*   Problems include\n    *   Economic: loss of homes and tourism (tourist guides and ski hotels lose tourists and hence income)\n    *   Social: less tourists arrive, tribes and displaced people must migrate\n    *   Environmental: loss of habitat and biomes as the alps receded for animals such as the Alpine ibex and Chamois\n\n\n## Changes in carbon stored in ice, oceans, and biosphere\n\n\n\n*   Before the industrial revolution, the amount of ice stored on land, in oceans, and in the biosphere was balanced, but human activity has tipped the balance\n*   Before the industrial revolution, the carbon concentration would only change through\n    *   Volcanic eruptions\n    *   Sea-floor spreading\n*   In the 1990s, human activity added 8.0 PgC, 6.4 of which acme from burning fossil fuels\n    *   The oceans absorbed 28% and the land 32%, the rest remaining in the atmosphere \n*   But in 2000–8, human activity added 9.1 PgC to the atmosphere annually, 7.7 PgC from fossil fuels and 1.4 PgC from deforestation and land -use change \n\n\n### Oceans\n\n\n\n*   More carbon increases warms the atmosphere and makes plants grow faster and store more carbon\n*   An increased carbon in the atmosphere has lead to more dissolving in the oceans\n    *   This endangers much marine life, especially shell-building animals as the acids dissolve and weaken the shells (weaken the carbonates of crabs and lobsters, and they end up with thinner shells)\n    *   The pH of water has dropped by 0.1 since 1750\n*   Warmer oceans decrease the abundance of phytoplankton, which grow more vigorously in cool, nutrient-rich waters such \n\n\n### Biosphere\n\n\n\n*   With the doubling carbon dioxide, plant growth increases by 12–76%\n*   Many forests are cleared for agricultural zones\n    *   However, if farmland is abandoned, such as in **Montserrat**, the vegetation ma revert to forest\n    *   By preventing wildfires, humans prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere, and instead it builds up in plants\n        *   Therefore, the use of fire to create new farmland releases considerable amounts of carbon into the atmosphere\n\n\n### Ice\n\n\n\n*   Permafrost contain large deposits of carbon, accumulate over thousands of years\n*   The low temperature reduces the rate of decomposition of organic plant matter, leading an accumulation of dead organic matter\n*   Warming of the peric glacier environments will lead to increased methane emissions\n*   Decreases show reduced reflectivity of the surface, increasing the absorption of solar radiation (positive feedback)\n\n\n## Changes in biomes\n\n\n\n*   Low-lying biomes such sa **mangroves** may be lost as a result of changes in sea level\n*   Climate change in the past has happened over long periods of time, allowing animals to adapt gradually to new conditions\n    *   Current increases in temperature are happening very rapidly, so there is less time for organisms to adapt\n    *   Organisms will either have to migrate or go extinct if they’re unable to adapt\n\n\n### Changes to agriculture\n\n\n\n*   Northward shift of wheat-growing in North America\n*   More difficult to irrigate fields due to limited water resources\n\n\n## Impact of climate change on people and places\n\n\n\n*   Organisms-based diseases such as malaria: new hotter conditions are better for mosquitoes to breed\n*   Migration due to changes in sea-level causes environmental-refugees\n*   Changes in tourism\n    *   Extended summers, which o=is good for coastal resorts in North America\n    *   Winter sports stopped due to lack of snow (in Aviemore, an in the Alps)\n    *   Reduced precipitation makes some locations economic due to water shortage\n\n\n### Social\n\n\n\n*   Hunger and conflict\n\n\n# Responding to climate change\n\n\n## Disparities in exposure\n\n\n\n*   **Exposure** is the degree to which people are exposed to climate change\n*   **Sensitivity** is the degree to which people could be harmed by exposure to climate change\n*   **Adaptive capacity** is the degree to which they could mitigate the potential harm by taking action to reduce their exposure or sensitivity\n*   Certain **populations** are more **vulnerable** than others: the very young, elderly, disabled, poor, minority groups, refugees, and indigenous people\n*   Certain **locations** are more **vulnerable** than others: low-lying islands, river mouths, valleys, coastal areas, regions deriving water supplies from mountain glaciers; therefore they face\n    *   Increased coastal erosion\n    *   Saline intrusion into groundwater supplies\n    *   Deterioration of coral reefs\n    *   Out-migration of people\n    *   Loss of income due to a decline in economic activities and infrastructure\n\n\n## Case study: Flooding in Bangladesh\n\n\n\n*   Most of Bangladesh lives along a delta formed by **three rivers** (**the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra**), which periodically flood the land\n    *   This is essential as it naturally irrigate the crops and increases soil fertility\n    *   However, since 1970, the scale, impact, and duration of these floods has increased, and there are still scientific prediction that it will continue increasing\n    *   A rise in temperatures of **2.6ºC** will lead to widespread repeated flooding\n    *   Due to **sea-level rise**, the densely populated coastal zone of Bangladesh is also increasingly vulnerable to coastal floods\n*   The flood damage is worsening due to the increased intensity of extreme precipitation events and the **14-40%** increase in monsoon rainfalls by the 2030s\n    *   Since 1990, the frencuney of extreme precipitation has increased in Narayanpur island as normal floods have become more catastrophic\n        *   Fewer than 1% can reach medical help within 1 hour as there is no suitable transport for those living by the indian border\n        *   People often have to sell assets post a flood to buy food and equipment\n*   Government and non-government organizations have been involved in reducing the impacts of flooding in Bangladesh\n    *   In 1988, after the most severe floodings of the 20th century, the government developed the **Flood Action Plan**\n        *   Sluice gates were built on a number of rivers, which provided protection from flooding by tidal waves and storm surges\n    *   5,700 km of embankments were also built\n    *   Neary 5,000 km of drainage channels were built\n    *   200 flood shelters on stilts for equation of people threatened by floods\n        *   Watch has brick toilets and septic tanks to reduce water contamination\n*   Impacts of the flood include\n    *   Personal security\n        *   Deaths from drowning, diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid\n        *   Loss of income\n        *   Loss or unavailability of fuelwood\n    *   Buildings and infrastructure\n        *   Tin-wall and mud houses washed away\n        *   Damage to temples, and factories\n    *   Crops and animals\n        *   Loss of livestock\n        *   Grain shortages\n        *   Damage to vegetation\n\n\n## Case study: Vulnerability and adaptation in Ghana\n\n\n\n*   In Ghana in West Africa, there are a number of adaptations include\n    *   Infrastructure development: building dams, levees, and seawalls\n    *   Ecosystem-based measures: preserving and restoring natural habitats such as mangrove swamps\n    *   Capacity development: education and to teach people new techniques and to empower people\n*   There are different impacts and adaptations in different zones\n    *   Northern Savanna\n        *   Increased morbidity and disease prevalence\n        *   Increased vulnerability of the poor\n        *   Increased out-mediation and loss of human capital\n    *   Forest\n        *   Decreased food security \n        *   Dry-ups of water bodies and underground water\n        *   Population pressure on land\n    *   Coastal Savanna\n        *   Decreased water availability and quality\n        *   Higher burden on women\n        *   Increased migration\n        *   Increased cholera\n\n\n## Government-led action\n\n\n### The UN Framework Concentration on climate change (1992)\n\n\n\n*   The objective was to prevent GHGs in the atmosphere to grow to dangerous levels\n*   It went into effect in 1994, but failed\n*   The **Kyoto Protocol (1997)** was the first major attempt to implement the treaty\n    *   HICs were required to cut carbon emissions by 20% by 2012 compared to the 1990 emissions\n    *   The US didn't sign while Canada and Australia did\n"},html:{writable:!0,enumerable:!0,value:"<h1>Causes of global climate change</h1>\n<h2>Structure of the

Himalayan region; glacier treatment could water shortages for up to 1.5 B people)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Combined with other factors such as population growth and high density of population, this issue is made worse</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Case study: retreat of Swiss glaciers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Swiss Alps declined from 1,800 km<sup>2</sup> in 1850 to 1,300 km<sup>2</sup> in 1972, a loss of ⅓ of the surface area</li>\n<li>The glacier changed substantially between 1882 and 2015\n<ul>\n<li>In 1882, it was 15 km long</li>\n<li>Between 1883 and 1885, it grew slowly, around 4 km; it remained steady for a few years</li>\n<li>It then repeated 26 m/yr for the next couple of years</li>\n<li>By 1920, it was retreating 10 m/yr</li>\n<li>Annual rates increase  in the 1920s</li>\n<li>In 2007–8, it retreated drastically, a total of 290 m</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It has retreated over 2.5 km over the last 130 years due to global warming</li>\n<li>Problems include\n<ul>\n<li>Economic: loss of homes and tourism (tourist guides and ski hotels lose tourists and hence income)</li>\n<li>Social: less tourists arrive, tribes and displaced people must migrate</li>\n<li>Environmental: loss of habitat and biomes as the alps receded for animals such as the Alpine ibex and Chamois</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changes in carbon stored in ice, oceans, and biosphere</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Before the industrial revolution, the amount of ice stored on land, in oceans, and in the biosphere was balanced, but human activity has tipped the balance</li>\n<li>Before the industrial revolution, the carbon concentration would only change through\n<ul>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n<li>Sea-floor spreading</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In the 1990s, human activity added 8.0 PgC, 6.4 of which acme from burning fossil fuels\n<ul>\n<li>The oceans absorbed 28% and the land 32%, the rest remaining in the atmosphere</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>But in 2000–8, human activity added 9.1 PgC to the atmosphere annually, 7.7 PgC from fossil fuels and 1.4 PgC from deforestation and land -use change</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Oceans</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>More carbon increases warms the atmosphere and makes plants grow faster and store more carbon</li>\n<li>An increased carbon in the atmosphere has lead to more dissolving in the oceans\n<ul>\n<li>This endangers much marine life, especially shell-building animals as the acids dissolve and weaken the shells (weaken the carbonates of crabs and lobsters, and they end up with thinner shells)</li>\n<li>The pH of water has dropped by 0.1 since 1750</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Warmer oceans decrease the abundance of phytoplankton, which grow more vigorously in cool, nutrient-rich waters such</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Biosphere</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>With the doubling carbon dioxide, plant growth increases by 12–76%</li>\n<li>Many forests are cleared for agricultural zones\n<ul>\n<li>However, if farmland is abandoned, such as in <strong>Montserrat</strong>, the vegetation ma revert to forest</li>\n<li>By preventing wildfires, humans prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere, and instead it builds up in plants\n<ul>\n<li>Therefore, the use of fire to create new farmland releases considerable amounts of carbon into the atmosphere</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ice</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Permafrost contain large deposits of carbon, accumulate over thousands of years</li>\n<li>The low temperature reduces the rate of decomposition of organic plant matter, leading an accumulation of dead organic matter</li>\n<li>Warming of the peric glacier environments will lead to increased methane emissions</li>\n<li>Decreases show reduced reflectivity of the surface, increasing the absorption of solar radiation (positive feedback)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changes in biomes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Low-lying biomes such sa <strong>mangroves</strong> may be lost as a result of changes in sea level</li>\n<li>Climate change in the past has happened over long periods of time, allowing animals to adapt gradually to new conditions\n<ul>\n<li>Current increases in temperature are happening very rapidly, so there is less time for organisms to adapt</li>\n<li>Organisms will either have to migrate or go extinct if they’re unable to adapt</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes to agriculture</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Northward shift of wheat-growing in North America</li>\n<li>More difficult to irrigate fields due to limited water resources</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Impact of climate change on people and places</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Organisms-based diseases such as malaria: new hotter
