<li>Set in the 1830s, after the Emancipation Act</li>
<li>Set in Jamaica</li>
<li>Victorian</li>
<li>Literature is response to society of the time time</li>
</ul>
<h2>Jean Rhys (author)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Struggled with being an actor as she was ostracized for her Caribbean heritage and accent, and eventually taken out from school</li>
<li>She became a writer during the “first-wave” feminism period</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>Jane Eyre</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>This was one of the earliest **feminist **books
<ul>
<li>It had to be published under a male pseudonym for that reason</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The story follows closely the life of the author, Charlotte Bronte</li>
<li>Wide Sargasso Sea is based on this book
<ul>
<li>The author of Wide Sargasso Sea felt that Bertha (Antoinette in Wide Sargasso Sea) was not portrayed in the best way possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The symbol of the <strong>fire</strong> is there in both books; it is a symbol of freedom
<ul>
<li>In Jane Eyre, Bertha commits suicide with fire</li>
<li>The symbol fire connects the two books, but the differences in perspectives and the husband unnamed keeps the two books apart and makes Wide Sargasso Sea its own story by giving Antoinette and identity (which was destroyed by the end)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>SIgnificance of the title</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>sea</strong> is a symbol to <strong>isolation</strong> referring to Antoinette</li>
<li>It is a sea which is in between many others, and from the outside, they all look the same, almost indistinguishable
<ul>
<li>However, Antoinette’s problems, although they might look common, are in fact very destructive</li>
<li>Not many people understood her problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is similar to Antoinette, most people think she has the same problems as everyone else, but her problems are more important: also, from the outside her problems really cannot be seen, only when we zoom in we can see them</li>
<li>The sea is also covered in seaweed and is unusually calm in the Bermuda triangle
<ul>
<li>Covered in seaweed shows the concealment, how her feelings were quite literally locked up (because of neglect by her mother)</li>
<li>Bermuda triangle is a place of conflict as it was believed to be a place of destruction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fact that it is “Wide” shows the big gap between the two ways of life of the colonizers and the creoles
<ul>
<li>Antoinette is figuratively in between Jamaica and England</li>
<li>She is neither colonial nor Jamaican, she is a white creole</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Although Antonette marries a colonizer, there is a difference in perspectives, priorities are too wide open and different, and there is not actual union between them
<ul>
<li>Antoinette’s husband is english while Antoinette is a woman whose identity is framed by her creole nature, and her ways are different from his, and so she was not accepted by locals</li>
<li>So the “<strong>wide</strong>” sea also represents a physical and geographical separation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Narrators</h1>
<ul>
<li>The novel follows a complicated narrative strategy with <strong>multiple perspectives</strong>
<ul>
<li>If we only saw Antoinette’s perspective, we will see her as a <strong>biased</strong> and <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>
<li>However, we see a more <strong>holistic view</strong> of her and how she has been affected through the different perspectives, which bring out the different facets of her character</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This comes in contrast to the single narrative in <em>Jane Eyre</em>; <em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em> is in <strong>response</strong> to that book
<ul>
<li><em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em> provides an explanation for why the madwoman exists in the first place</li>
<li>In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, there is only one narrative account in her name, and although she was marginalized for being poor, she didn't suffer from the racial implications</li>
<li>For her, the madwoman is just crazy, and she doesn’t go into details to why she is mad
<ul>
<li>To JE, the madwoman (Antoinette) is a villain in her happiness</li>
<li>So JR provides multiple reasons why the “madwomen” even exists, and why she is locked up</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 1: Antoinette</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Jane Eyre, Bertha Mason’s story is told from the perspective of the narrator, Jane Eyre, who views her as the ‘madwomen’</li>
<li>In this novel, she gets to voice her own experience</li>
<li>In the story, we see her change from child to adolescent</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unreliable narrator</h3>
<ul>
<li>The narration makes the readers feel “closer” to the storyteller as she expressed her inner thoughts, feelings, and also dreams however this makes us as the readers less critical and blind to her faults as it is easier to sympathize for her</li>
<li>Her story is full of gaps and silence, and also secrets
<ul>
<li>There are certain parts of the story she chooses not to disclose</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stream of consciousness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allows the mingling of a child’s perspective to the older narrator's memories</li>
<li>As she watches Pierre sleep, she reflects on Mr Mason’s plans, the future, and the bamboos</li>
<li>All these descriptions come in sharp contrast to the events yet to come</li>
<li>At the beginning, most of the events happen in order but later, it is left to the readers understand as if they are a part of the story</li>
<li>Stream of consciousness also reflects on her uncertainties: this is seen through her lack of traditional sentence structures, and lack of formal dialogues
<ul>
<li>Her thoughts are <strong>disjointed</strong> as there are gaps in understanding and narration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She is only recollecting various disconnected thoughts, and sharing her personal thoughts: this gives the reader a glimpse into her mind as she does not share everything</li>
<li>There are many gaps in the narrative (makes her an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong>)
<ul>
<li>One gap was after the burning down of the Coulibri
<ul>
<li>The gap shows that she feels shocked and is in a state of bewilderment or fear</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There was a minor gap after Annett asks her whose dress she was wearing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 2: Antoinette’s husband</h2>
<ul>
<li>Her husband also receives his own point of view and in the story this allows for
<ul>
<li>Different points of view on his experienced and relathips offered to readers</li>
<li>Readers to feel closer to his experience, and not only Antoinette’s</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similar to Antoinette, he also has dislocated experienced of
<ul>
<li>New cultural experienced</li>
<li>Intense sensual effects of the world</li>
<li>Sexual passion</li>
<li>Memory and relations with family</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>JR uses a range of narrative techniques for representing the confused responses to the world and people around him</li>
<li>His first person narrative is manipulated to reveal is precarious sense of his own identity</li>
<li>The setting is <strong>overwhelming</strong> to him, and he feels disconnected</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stream of consciousness</h3>
<ul>
<li>His stream of consciousness makes the novel <strong>less</strong> <strong>biased</strong>, and it introduces the idea of Antoinette’s voice being <strong>muted</strong>, which is further emphasized by the setting change (England, a place Antoinette doesn't feel comfortable in)</li>
<li>There are often differences in what he things and what he says</li>
<li>He has many cultural confusions</li>
<li>He does not understand the colonizers</li>
</ul>
<h3>Daniel cosway</h3>
<ul>
<li>He provides many of the details Antoinette never told Rochester</li>
<li>However, he does not mention the fire at the Coulibri that lead to Annette's grief and hence madness</li>
<li>He is therefore an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 3: Grace Poole and Antoinette</h2>
<ul>
<li>The first italicized part is by Grace Poole, Antoinette’s jailer</li>
<li>The second part is narrated by Antoinette, who is now the “madwoman in the attic”</li>
<li>She employs <strong>stream of consciousness</strong> through inner monologue</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other</h3>
<ul>
<li>Other characters are also given their own stories, although not through first-person narratives</li>
<li>We only hear their voice through dialogs, letters</li>
</ul>
<h3>Annette</h3>
<ul>
<li>We get Antoinette’s memories of her, her dialogs reported by Antoinette, gossip and comments of servants and other family members, and information given to Rochester by Daniel Cosway And Christophine</li>
<li>Her descriptions can be contradictory as Antoinette is an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>
<li>Antoinette doesn't describe her mother’s decline until she is forced to explain her family history to Rochester in Part 2
<ul>
<li>This also shows that they were never close (expanded below)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Aunt Cora and Mr Mason</h3>
<ul>
<li>Antoinette’s memories, speech and dialog, gossip</li>
<li>We also get conflicted opinions of them</li>
</ul>
<h3>White community</h3>
<ul>
<li>Antoinette’s speech often slips into recounting local white gossip about her family</li>
<li>This method of narration ensures that the voice remains hers, but also reveals the values and attitudes of the white community to which she belongs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Christophine</h3>
<p>Her character is constructed from</p>
<ul>
<li>Antoinette’s first person narrative: her importance as an influence is demonstrated by the amount of attention she is given in Antoinette’s memories
<ul>
<li>Her appearance, manner, and personality are carefully described early in Part 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gossip and fragments of dialog retold by Antoinette reveal the attitudes of other people</li>
<li>Rochester’s POV: he initially sees her as a servant, but he ends up treating her with hostility once he suspects her of using obeah practices on him
<ul>
<li>Although the part is narrated by Rochester, she is given her own voice by inserting sections of dialog, in which she confronts Rochester in a very dramatic way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Letter from Mr Frazer to Rochester: we see an opinion on her held by the judicial element within the white community</li>
</ul>
<h3>Daniel Cosway</h3>
<p>He is represented within Rochester's first person narration</p>
<ul>
<li>Letters; he sends two letters to Rochester in which he presents his perspective on Antoinette’s family background, which Fuels Rochester's suspensions about insanity</li>
<li>Dialog: his speech is reported by Rochester
<ul>
<li>He can command in different styles of speech with rhetorical and biblical resonances</li>
<li>He modulates into more natural styles of speech later</li>
<li>However, his dialog is presented by Rochester, and is therefore colored by his perspective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He is also an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Black servants and the blacks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mainly reported through speech and dialog in Antoinette’s narration</li>
<li>The wider black community is notably silent in the novel</li>
</ul>
<h1>Structure</h1>
<ul>
<li>There are two main narrators: <strong>Antoinette’s husband</strong> (unnamed) and <strong>Antoinette</strong>, creating a duality of antagonist and protagonist: this creates dichotomy as both are protagonists during the time they narrate the story</li>
<li>This dichotomy creates a <strong>contrast</strong> in personality, themes, and cultures</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conflict of cultures and characters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Antoinette is part of the West Indies culture while Rochester comes from a patriarchal, colonial power</li>
<li>We see the differences in their ideologies: Antoinette likes nature and prefers to be in the garden while Rochester says: “I hated the mountains and the hills, the rivers and the rain. I hated the sunsets of whatever colour, I hated its beauty and it’s magic and the secret I would never know.” Whatever Antoinette describes evokes sympathy and emotion, while Rochester finds the sun and vibrant colors overwhelming: he does not understand interrelations of black and white</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contrast of themes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Need to finish</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why is the book divided into different parts?</h2>
<ul>
<li>To show the flow of time: from childhood, to adolescence, and then a sudden shift to marriage</li>
<li>To show a shift in her mental status
<ul>
<li>To show that she tries to find security, but fails to do so
<ul>
<li>In Part 2, she tries to find security, but fails to do so</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sympathies</h3>
<ul>
<li>In Part 1, we are sympathetic to Antoinette</li>
<li>In Part 2, we are still sympathetic towards her
<ul>
<li>But we get to know her story through her husband, so it is counter-intuitive that we do not sympathize for the narrator</li>
<li>Although we see all his thoughts and motives, we don't sympathize for him</li>
<li>Even after known that he a victim of parental influence and manipulation (forced marriage), we don't sympathize for him</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Part 1</h1>
<ul>
<li>Narrated by Antoinette; she describes her childhood</li>
<li>There is little flow in the stories with many skips between events as she recollects; one event does not lead to another</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<ol>
<li>Antoinette
<ul>
<li>Her childhood experiences have shaped her character: she receives no comfort or love from her mother, and is <strong>mocked in the society for her origins</strong>, something she cannot control
<ul>
<li>She is constantly compared to her mother too (in a bad way), which is, again, something which is out of reach: “Look the crazy girl, you like your mother … She have eyes like zombi and you have eyes like zombi too”</li>
<li>This also foreshadows that she will end up like her mother</li>
<li>It also shows that others don't see her as a human being because she is of a different race.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Her one true friend or solace she found ended up joining the society in mocking her after stealing from her
<ul>
<li>This, in a way, caused her to be determined to be away from people, as she was neglected, and Tia betrayed her</li>
<li>We found out early on that her mother was not fond of her as she ignored her and seldom talked to her, so Antoinette gradually started to avoid people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similar to the Garden (symbol), she was <strong>left (neglected) to grow wild</strong>, with no care or guidance
<ul>
<li>She was rejected by her mother</li>
<li>She also states that the company of the grasses was “better, better than people” – it is clear that she was <strong>neglected</strong> as a child</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the remarriage, she finds her own home <strong>alienating</strong> as she has a new fear of Christophine and her practices of Obeah, although she grew up trusting her
<ul>
<li>This fear is based off of gossip she hears in the wedding, and she is struggling to determine what is true</li>
<li>We feel sympathetic towards her as she feels unsafe in her own home</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After her dress is stolen by Tia, Christophine argues with Annette about how she doesn't have any more dresses: “She run wild, she grow up worthless. And nobody care”</li>
<li>She is highly emotional and easily feels afraid and hatred, but learns to conceal it after numerous traumatic incidents in her life
<ul>
<li>She was forced to conceal her fears and emotions as she was neglected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She often decides not to talk about certain ideas: she decides not to verbalize certain things in the hope that they are not true
<ul>
<li>When the horse died, and when they became “marooned”, she did not tell anyone in the hope that it was not true</li>
<li>Also, when Mr Mason mentions a suitor, she gets a feeling of insecurity as she will lose her freedom, but she decides to ignore it in the hope that ignoring it will make it disappear
<ul>
<li>she understands the <strong>suffocating</strong> truths of marriage, as she has seen them in her mother</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Annette
<ul>
<li>Antoinette spends most of her early narration describing her mother, and see her progression from a beautiful Creole women who is ostracized by the society to a quite “thin” women who has lost any hope to live</li>
<li>She finally descends to madness after the fire, and learning that Pierre is dead; she loses all hopes and fears and to her death is the best way out
<ul>
<li>She has become disconnected from herself and her emotions as she has lost everything: her husband, her status (after the Emancipation act), and her son, so she chooses her ignore her family and try to escape it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We see her signs of instability when she “speaks aloud to herself”, although the arrival of the Luttrell's gives her a new hope</li>
<li>She is never able to reconnect with Antoinette and wants to leave the past behind</li>
<li>The fact that her death/funeral is not described in detail shows the distance between Antoinette and Annette
<ul>
<li>We actually only understands what happens to the mother when she described it to Rochester; this shows the disconnect between Antoinette and her mother</li>
<li>Information about her that is unrevealed comes to readers through gossip, such as her death</li>
<li>This shows that Antoinette thought that it wasn't important anymore as she neglected her so much during childhood – their disconnect is clear</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She foreshadows her daughter’s future as she goes insane as a result of what her husband did
<ul>
<li>The similarity between their names also foreshadows that they will have similar lives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We later learn in Part 2 that she was sexualy abused by the caretakesr, but Antoinette was unable to mention it because of the trauma she was going through
<ul>
<li>She also refused to describe it in the hopes that it did not actually happen</li>
<li>The caretakers were black, and shows a role reversal as usually the white slave owners would force sexual relationships with the black slaves before emancipation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Christophine
<ul>
<li>She is the one person who stands by Antoinette’s side, and she teaches her the importance of her Creole heritage and to be proud of it through her songs</li>
<li>She herself expresses her heritage boldy through the way she dresses, but still tries to fit in by maintaining her accent</li>
<li>She is feared by the locals as she practises obeah</li>
<li>“She was your father's wedding present”: she was a freed slave, and she shows loyalty to Annette and her family and does not abandon them</li>
<li>She is very close to Anette, she even says “Some people say/think [Annette] crazy” when Annette does not understand how poor they are
<ul>
<li>This also suggests the intimacy of their relationship</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the coulibri is renovated, Antoinette has a new fear of her due to obeah
<ul>
<li>Because of this and the new servants combined with her neglecting mother, she finds her new home very alienating.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tia
<ul>
<li>She is the representative of the society to Antoinette</li>
<li>Before making friends with Antoinette, she insulted her</li>
<li>When Antoinette decides to go live with her, Tia throws a rock at her forehead, showing that she was never accepted by her</li>
<li>She bettered Antoinette in greed for money and through of her as a “white nigger”; she also taunts Antoinette by saying “we ate salt fish”
<ul>
<li>She means to say that because Antoinette is so poor, she cannot afford fresh fish</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She could be one of the driving forces in Antoinette’s life because she constantly mentions her name (in dreams and later in the book)</li>
<li>She stole Antoinette's clothes and hence her identity</li>
<li>Although they got along, money drew them apart again
<ul>
<li>The childish bet and disagreement reflects the socio-economic disparity between the whites and the blacks</li>
<li>The fact the Tia steals Antoinette’s dress and her money highlights the symbolic significance of appearance and attire in female power and security in the novel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mr Mason
<ul>
<li>He is a representative of the white slave owners, a wealthy plantation owner</li>
<li>He portrays the theme of ignorance as he does not take Annette seriously about moving out; he is self-centered as he wants to make more money
<ul>
<li>He does not see Annette’s point of view because he does not understand racial relations on the island (similar to Rochester)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He is a new breed of the white men as he is cunning and bends laws to fit them to his liking: although the Emancipation Act ended the reign of slave owners, neo-colonialism takes place</li>
<li>Although Annette has no money, he still married her because he found her beautiful, but when he discovers that she is mentally ill, he locks her up in inhuman conditions
<ul>
<li>The fact that Annette and Antoinette are similar foreshadows that even Antoinette will end up in similar conditions</li>
<li>Sending Antoinette to be married can be similar to being locked up as she is sent against her will as she did not get a choice</li>
<li>In the end, she ended up getting locked up too: both their lives ended in similar ways</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He has a dislike towards Aunt Cora as she did not help their family during the time of need (find page)
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, she was a successful woman, and saying that he dislikes her makes him superior as he is a man and hence he holds more power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He misunderstands the locals and does not understand how dangerous they can be: “They're too damn lazy to be dangerous”, “They are children––they wouldn't hurt a fly”, “handful of drunken negroes”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pierre
<ul>
<li>He “staggered when he walked and couldn't speak distinctly”; he is mentally disabled</li>
<li>He is later described as an idiot to Rochester by Daniel Cosway the bastard
<ul>
<li>Rochester thought that the disease was genetic when it was not, so he thought Antoinette was also crazy like him</li>
<li>This can be linked to ADH: Dr. Rank’s diseases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Annette “changed” after hearing the doctor about Pierre’s conditions, suggesting that it was an incurable disease, that was likely a burden for the family</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mr Luttrell
<ul>
<li>Kills his dog and goes to the sea never to come back
<ul>
<li>He has no money</li>
<li>After the Emancipation Act, he had nothing</li>
<li>He is a white male who was lost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He was in a state of despair following the Emancipation Act</li>
<li>His death sets the mood for the rest of the events, the mood of <strong>despair and disillusionment</strong></li>
<li>His death gives Antoinette the troubled ideas of freedom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sandi Cosway
<ul>
<li>She is Antoinette’s black cousin: “I knew who he was, his name was Sandi, Alexander Cosway’s son. Once I would have said ‘my cousin Sandi’ but Mr Mason’s lectures had made me shy about my coloured relatives”</li>
<li>Mr Mason and his Superior Englishman attitude influenced Antoinette with Sandi Cosway
<ul>
<li>Antoinette understood that Mr Mason would not accept any friendship/relationship between her and Sandi</li>
<li>Mr Mason disliked Antoinette’s creole family (including Aunt Cora)</li>
<li>Mr Mason is also representative of the English society and their mindset, so the difference in skin color is a barrier that keeps the two apart: this social barrier is heavily linked to racial differences, which had heightened during this time period after the Emancipation Act</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Isolation and ostracizing based on races, and racial discrimination; alienation
<ul>
<li>Creoles are seen as being in between as they are not black or white, and are therefore not accepted in the society</li>
<li>Antoinette refers to non-creoles using the word “<strong>they</strong>” showing a disconnect and clear distinction between the two; this word is used quite early on in the novel suggestion animosity between blacks and whites in Jamaica</li>
<li>The fact that the family had to “[persuade] a Spanish Town doctor to visit” Pierre demonstrates the tension between the whites and blacks</li>
<li>The racial hierarchy in the 1830s in Jamaica was complex and strained with tensions between whites and creoles
<ul>
<li>There was resentment which lead to hatred and violence such as the Cosways being referred to as “<strong>white cockroaches</strong>”, and eventually being driven away from their homes from their former selves</li>
<li>These dynamics are also complicated by exclusion based on race, geographical origin, appearance, wealth, and status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Major characters in the novel are defined by their inclusion or exclusion from cultural groups
<ul>
<li>Although Antoinette and the Cosways where white, they were not the dominant group of Jamaica as they were creoles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alienation leads to the characters of the novel being destructive too: Anette, driven by her family’s exclusions from white society, seeks marriage to Mr Mason, and this ultimately leads to the loss of her son and hence her sanity.</li>
<li>From the beginning, we see that Antoinette’s family is dysfunctional, and she is quite isolated because of this</li>
<li>The love marriage of Cosway was not happy as he had many bastard children with other women</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internal isolation from family and neglect
<ul>
<li>This is one of the most prominent themes in the novel, and highly relates to Antoinette: she was constantly neglected from her mother, whose voice was neglected by Mr Mason</li>
<li>It was because of neglect that Annette was cast as an outsider, which leads to her mental breakdown</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Effect of the Emancipation Act on the society
<ul>
<li>The Emancipation Act of 1833 leaves discontent and violence as seen in Mr Luttrell, a white former slave owner, who commited suicide as he was unable to adjust to the new social and economic landscape.</li>
<li>Although the Emancipation Act freed slaves, slave owners suffered as shown by the Cosway family. For example, at Coulibri, the local population of black former slaves are deeply angry. Antoinette also says “They hated us”. She was also called a “white cockroach, go away, go away. Nobody want you”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ignorance and money, the reason Mr Mason did not want to leave</li>
<li>Women and power
<ul>
<li>Annette wanted to leave the Coulibri, but was unable to as she couldn't convince Mr Mason
<ul>
<li>Similar to how the bird’s wings were clipped, she has a lack of independence in the marriage: the bird’s wings are a metaphor for her independence which is being diminished by Mr Mason</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Symbols</h2>
<ol>
<li>The garden
<ul>
<li>The garden at the Coulibri is a symbol of life, or eventually Antoinette as it too runs wild because it is uncared for</li>
<li>Antoinette finds comfort in the moss of the garden and enjoys wondering about the unexplored areas
<ul>
<li>She was <strong>forced</strong> to find comfort in the garden because she was <strong>neglected</strong> by annette, her mother.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Although she finds beauty in the overgrown orchids, she is afraid to go near them</li>
<li>Different parts of the garden may present her qualities and her desires</li>
<li>Antoinette described the garden with many bright colors: “green, white, purple”; she loves these colors and mentions them many times, while Rochester dislikes them and prefers brown and white instead</li>
<li>“Snakey” looking is a biblical allusion to the snake, which is likely overgrown?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fire
<ul>
<li>In the novel, fire represents <strong>freedom and rebellion</strong> (Part 1, page 21, 22, and the end of Part 3)</li>
<li>The ex-slaves set fire to the Coulibri as an act of <strong>defiance</strong> after being free following the Emancipation Act</li>
<li>“So black and white, they burn the same, eh? (23)”: this, in a way, unites the whites and the blacks</li>
<li>Furthermore, at the end of the play, it is suggested that Antoinette committed suicide with fire. In Jane Eyre, Antoinette (Bertha) commits suicide with fire, hence it symbolizes her <strong>rebellion</strong> in order to escape her husband</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hair
<ul>
<li>It is a symbol of the female characters’ agency and identity</li>
<li>At the time of the fire, Annette’s mother had disheveled hair, showing that she is not taken seriously and that her identity doesn't mean anything to Mr Mason</li>
<li>The fact that Antoinette’s hair has been cut without her knowledge foreshadows that she will slowly lose her identity and agency (This is true because her husband gives her a new name, Bertha, hence she loses her identity, and she also loses her freedom and has to follow her husband's orders)
<ul>
<li>Her identity is also being lost as she has lost her father and brother, and her mother is soon to die.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eventually, Rochester calls her Bertha, which is not her real name
<ul>
<li>This is shows that she has lost her identity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clothes
<ul>
<li>Symbolizes wealth, but only temporary in Part 1</li>
<li>Clothes and money are divided: as Tia steals the dress</li>
<li>Link to ADH: the <strong>tarantella dress</strong> is symbol/motif and is linked to <strong>objectification</strong> of women</li>
<li>However, the removal of dresses in ADH heads to empowerment for the women while it is (bad for Antoinette)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Beginning racism
<ul>
<li>It is a powerful opening beginning with racism: “the Jamaican ladies had never approved of my mother” – the beginning shows that they were excluded socially
<ul>
<li>Many people had criticized her mother for being a widow</li>
<li>This shows that in order for women to be successful, they had to have a man as they had a <strong>lack of agency</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fallout between Tia and Antoinette was because of a racial tension, and it also foreshadows the relation with her husband</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Women and agency
<ul>
<li>Women with a husband/partner have a lack of agency when compared to those who decided not to marry</li>
<li>This is evident in the case of Annette: she married twice and has a lack of agency and ends up being locked up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Antoinette’s many dreams (pages 11 and 34)
<ul>
<li>Dreams are prevalent in Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea, in which they give us views of expressed and <strong>unexpressed emotions</strong>, and they <strong>foreshadow</strong> certain events</li>
<li>Dreams in Wide Sargasso Sea contain <strong>parallel imagery</strong> to the dreams of Jane Eyre; the dreams on Antoinette are <strong>clairvoyant</strong> like Jane’s dreams, which reflect on a part of her consciousness</li>
<li>In the novel, Antoinette has three dreams which are essentially of the same event, and they give us insight onto Antoinette’s maturing character and provide foreshadow</li>
<li>The first dream is in her childhood when Tia steals her pennies and dress: “I dreamed that I was walking in the forest. Not alone. Someone who hated me was with me, out of sight. I could hear heavy footsteps coming closer and though I struggled and screamed, I could not move. I woke crying.”
<ul>
<li>This reflects on the young Antoinette's <strong>undeveloped sense of self-awareness</strong></li>
<li>The fact that it is in the <strong>past tense</strong> suggests that Antoinette is distances from her dream consciousness, and the vagueness of the threat in her dream suggests that she herself does not understand her fears</li>
<li>“Safe from the strangers”
<ul>
<li>Unknown what she is scared of</li>
<li>Does not understand her fears</li>
<li>Rudimentary dream which develops later</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both Antoinette’s and Jane’s dreams are recurring: Antoinette had her “bad dream” again at the age of seventeen when Mr Mason tells her that he is arranging for suitors to visit her</li>
<li>“Again I have left the house at Coulibri. It is still night and I am walking towards the forest. I am wearing a long dress and thin slippers, so I walk with difficulty, following the man who is with me and holding up the skirt of my dress. It is white and beautiful and I don't wish to get it soiled. I follow him, sick with fear but I make no effort to save myself; if anyone were to try to save me, I would refuse. This must happen. Now we have reached the forest. We are under the tall dark trees and there is no wind. "Here?" He turns and looks at me, his face black with hatred, and when I see this I begin to cry. He smiles slyly. "Not here, not yet," he says, and I follow him, weeping. Now I do not try to hold up my dress, it trails in the dirt, my beautiful dress. We are no longer in the forest but in an enclosed garden surrounded by a stone wall and the trees are different trees. I do not know them. There are steps leading upwards. It is too dark to see the wall or the steps, but I know they are there and I think, "It will be when I go up these steps. At the top." I stumble over my dress and cannot get up. I touch a tree and my arms hold on to it. 'Here, here.' But I think I will not go any further. The tree sways and jerks as if it is trying to throw me off. Still I cling and the seconds pass and each one is a thousand years. "Here, in here," a strange voice said, and the tree stopped swaying and jerking. [34]”
<ul>
<li>Stream of consciousness</li>
<li>Unlike the first dream, this second one occurs in the present tense, suggesting that the problems are more [present], and that she has grown closer to her dream consciousness</li>
<li>Furthermore, the plot of the second dream is more <strong>clear</strong>, suggesting greater <strong>intelligence and perception</strong>, whereas the first one is <strong>vague</strong> with terms such as: “walking in the forest” with “someone who hated me”
<ul>
<li>She understands that there is a “man” who is “black with hatred”</li>
<li>This could show how she is maturing and hence understands her problems much better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fact that she attempts to keep the dress unsoiled demonstrates her concern with maintaining sexual purity
<ul>
<li>It also shows that she is submissive towards him, which she is (in the future)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This dream foreshadows the problems she will soon face with Rochester: the pure dress represents a wedding dress and the man with “hatred” represents Rochester, and her reluctance to join him symbolizes her reluctance to join Rochester</li>
<li>Later in the book, she blindly listens to Rochester and performs sexual intimacy (she “masochistically and insistently lays herself on [the] sexual altar” and complies to all his orders) and “[makes] no effort to save [herself]”</li>
<li>“Smile slyly”: Rochester, stays with her just to maintain property and money, shows how detrimental marriage is to her</li>
<li>She trips on dress and unable to get up = marriage (wedding trap) traps her and is detrimental to her</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Antoinette's safety
<ul>
<li>She never finds safety: her house on fire, unsafe marriage, improvement in England non-existent</li>
<li>She was unsafe because she was unloved as a daughter (because of her gender)</li>
<li>Discrimination also haunts her</li>
<li>Women could only gain security through marriage or the convent school
<ul>
<li>The convent was quite patriarchal, and Antoinette struggled to adjust there</li>
<li>She struggled to fit as the convert was based off of religion, which is opposed to black magic, which she grew up with Christophine</li>
<li>Therefore, the convent creates an identity crisis</li>
<li>Antoinette learns that women must be with men at the convent school, and she is trained to be a good wife: this relates to the theme of <strong>women and freedom</strong> as women had to live their life being in control of men, by learning how to please them</li>
<li>Antoinette knows that marriage means a loss in freedom as she will be controlled by her husband
<ul>
<li>She decides not to talk to anyone about this in the hope that it is not true</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h1>Part 2</h1>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<ol>
<li>Antoinette
<ul>
<li>She feels <strong>isolation</strong> because she cannot connect emotionally to her husband, and also because of <strong>interracial differences</strong> as she belongs to creoles of french</li>
<li>She is forced to turn to Christophone for protection when she’s scared
<ul>
<li>She asks him to make her husband love her using Obeah, but she is unable to (theme of <strong>supernatural</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the end of this Part, she is referred to as a <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.9x7rpt4yhono">Doll</a></strong></li>
<li>No one knows why the town is called Massacre and its history, and this foreshadows the <strong>fall of the marriage</strong> and the <strong>loss of identity</strong> of Antoinette</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Her husband
<ul>
<li>This part is narrated from his <strong>point of view</strong>, and although he is inhuman, his actions are explained by his suffering, confusion and feelings of alienation</li>
<li>He is also distant from Antoinette and treats her like a stranger and analyzes her appearance critically (in a bad way)
<ul>
<li>He also misunderstands her local culture and considers her language inferior</li>
<li>His detachment from heirs cleaner, so he critically evaluates her without feeling any emotions for her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is also implied that he is detached from her own family</li>
<li>He carelessly crushes the wedding wreaths: this foreshadows that he will treat the marriage carelessly</li>
<li>When he and her try to connect, the differences are made more clear and his only way to understand her is to compare her to an english girl: she ”might have been any pretty English girl”</li>
<li>Unlike Antoinette, he feels alienated and threatened by landscape and nature.</li>
<li>There is a clear difference between his and Antoinette’s structure in terms of emotional expression
<ul>
<li>He sees Baptiste looking mournful and finds the Caribbean way of displaying emotions as weak and vulnerable as compared to the English way of hiding and concealing emotions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Of the wedding, he only remembers the marble and Antoinette’s <strong>cold hands</strong> (“It was cold as ice in the hot sun (47)”), suggesting that he feels no love of feelings/emotions for her at all</li>
<li>One reason why he is <strong>disoriented</strong> and dislikes Antoinette with passion is because for him, she is emblematic of the Jamaican landscape, which he doesn't not enjoy as he dislikes the landscape and nature, as opposed to Antoinette, who finds comfort in nature.</li>
<li>After seeing the letter (28), he gets lost in the forest, this can be related to Antoinette's dream
<ul>
<li>Unlike Antoinette, he is not well-versed with nature so he gets lost easily</li>
<li>He also has less of an appeal to other people, so the girl was scared of him, and this is reinforced as he did not even realize/recognize Baptise looking for him, although it could have been because he was quite disoriented</li>
<li>This comes in stark contrast to Antoinette’s dream at the end of Part 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is sexual tension between him and Amélie, which foreshadows their sexual relationship</li>
<li>He pities himself, although Antoinette is the bigger victim
<ul>
<li>He is able to self-pity as he holds more power in their relationship</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We never see him working; he is living off the money he earned as a slave owner</li>
<li>He has limited power as compared to other english men as he was the second son
<ul>
<li>He had no choice; he was forced to listen to his father</li>
<li>But he still made his own (bad, incorrect) choices like cheating on Antoinette when he could have been a better husband, so readers do not sympathize for him (even though we see everything from his point of view)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He wants to care for Antoinette, but decides not to due to his bitter feelings
<ul>
<li>He also does not care for the boy who learned English in the hopes of staying with him</li>
<li>When the boy cries like that, he feels he is crying “for nothing”, reiterating the fact that he shows no remorse</li>
<li>After a struggle between compassion and bitterness, bitterness has taken over completely</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Daniel Cosway
<ul>
<li>He is another character similar to Antoinette who has led a life of inherited suffering
<ul>
<li>His is likely her half-brother, a result of Cosway and a slave</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While Antoinette is culturally different from everyone else around her, Daniel is racially different as he has a black mother and white father</li>
<li>Daniel is a bastard son, similar to Antoinette who was rejected as a child by her mother</li>
<li>Both he and Antoinette share their sense of <strong>isolation, displacement, and anger</strong></li>
<li>Letter of page 59: he is spiteful and attacks Antoinette and his and her family by stating how madness runs in the family
<ul>
<li>There were tensions between emancipated slaves and their owners.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He wants revenge on Antoinette and the Cosways as his existence was <strong>marginalized</strong>
<ul>
<li>He holds them responsible for his situation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No one is truly sure about his identity and origins
<ul>
<li>Even Amélie, who seems to know him is unsure about his real name</li>
<li>Everyone relies on gossip to know who is truly is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Christophine
<ul>
<li>She believes that most women are foolish to rely only on their husbands, so she stays single so that she can stay independent, although she has had three children from different men</li>
<li>She also has her own money: “I keep my money. I don't give it to no worthless man”</li>
<li>When Christophine gives Antoinette her inheritance, the wealth now belongs to her husband
<ul>
<li>She and Antoinette loses money this way</li>
<li>She calls Mr Mason “worse than Satan” as he got Antoinette and forced her (sold her) into marrying Rochester</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She is shown to not easily trust people; her distrust is clear
<ul>
<li>she does not believe that England exists: “I never see the damn place, how I know?”</li>
<li>This differentiates her from Antoinette, who relies on trust (she trusts her geography books)</li>
<li>Christophone treats that place she has never personally experienced with skepticism</li>
<li>She also does not even trust her own son (Jo-jo) to not leak out what Antoinette and her have been planning: she described him as “Nothing but leaky calabash that boy"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She uses obeah to make Rochester love Antoinette again, but ends up fleeing as he knows that she has drugged him
<ul>
<li>This gets her in trouble with the law, so she has to leave Antoinette, and cannot help her anymore as she is powerless</li>
<li>It is Mr Fraser who informs the husband that she is a practitioner of Obeah and considers her dangerous as she has a criminal record</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aunt Cora
<ul>
<li>She is shown to be defeated in comparison to Christophine as she “she turned her face to the wall”</li>
<li>She was unable to help Antoinette escape the control of Mr Mason and Richard Mason, who married her to Rochester to get money</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Amélie
<ul>
<li>A maid at Granbois who shows no respect for the husband and Antoinette, although she fears Christophone</li>
<li>She flirtatiously mocks Rochester until he sleeps with her</li>
<li>She has sex with the husband, and Antoinette is fully aware of it
<ul>
<li>Her husband decides to sleep with her just to mess with Antoinette and maker her weaker than she already is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Young Bull
<ul>
<li>His name illustrates his aggressive desire for dominance</li>
<li>He tries to impress Rochester by showing that he can speak English and demonstrating his knowledge</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Alienation
<ul>
<li>Daniel Cosway, a mixed-race illegitimate child of Cosway, wants to gain revenge for everyone marginalizing his existence
<ul>
<li>His exclusion from the Cosway family leads to him to write a series of letters to Rochester <strong>maligning</strong> Antoinette and the rest of her family</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These <strong>letters</strong> disturb Rochester and are the <strong>catalyst</strong> for his ultimate distrust and distaste for Antoinette (Link to ADH as paper is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.jx83je1nb652">catalyst</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obeah and colonial mindset
<ul>
<li>Everyone feared obeah for what it could do</li>
<li>Antoinette’s husband has a colonial viewpoint, so he distrusted Christophine for her Obeah practices</li>
<li>Through obeah, Antoinette tries to change her husband</li>
<li>When the husband knows that he has been manipulated by obeah, he decides to take away Antoinette's <strong>identity</strong> by naming her Bertha
<ul>
<li>He attacks her physcologically</li>
<li>This changing of her name also shows that he holds all the power in the relationship</li>
<li>It is ironic that an unnamed character is able to strip a named (main) character from her identity so easily; this shows how much power colonial men had (patriarchal society)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Symbols</h2>
<ol>
<li>Typical white colonists of the time (see Antoinette’s husband remains unnamed in Part 2)
<ul>
<li>He is not named, and Rhys generalizes all white colonists to be similar to him
<ul>
<li>Rhys wants us to sympathize for Antoinette (even though her husband is the narrator), and she does this by not giving him a name</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being a colonist, he is a person who ‘extracts what he needs’: for this reason, he disliked nature</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Antoinette’s husband remains unnamed
<ul>
<li>This is done so that the writer can use his character to represent all typical white colonists – he is symbolic to all of them as he is a perfect example of one</li>
<li>This is furthered by the fact that he does not work and he only drinks; white colonists would have all the servants do work for them</li>
<li>Furthermore, the writer only wants to represent the point of view of Antoinette, so giving him a name and hence an identity is difficult and will go against the main point in the novel</li>
<li>It is deeply <strong>ironic</strong> that the <strong>unnamed</strong> character robbed the main characters of her name and her identity: although he is unnamed, he holds power as he is a man</li>
<li>He also wants to distance himself from her</li>
<li>Not giving him a name essentially generalizes him and all other white colonial men</li>
<li>On the other hand, women are individualized, as Antoinette is given a name and also given more emphasis to as this is a feminist novel</li>
<li>The story is also mainly through the feminine perspective, and his name is not mentioned so that Antoinette can occupy the center stage</li>
<li>The fact that he is unnamed also creates a <strong>cold sense of unfamiliarity</strong> which allows to relate with Antoinette as she is also in anew place</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The letter from Daniel Cosway
<ul>
<li>Antoinette’s husband says that he was expecting the letter, and this shows that he never truly loved her: “I felt no surprise. It was as if I’d expected it, been waiting for it (62)”</li>
<li>Daniel writes a letter to Rochester stating that he is an illegitimate child of Mr Cosway</li>
<li>Similar to A Doll’s House, paper is a catalyst</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Part 3</h1>
<ul>
<li>Narrated by Grace Poole, a character who gives a <strong>less biased</strong> view of the story</li>
<li>There are shifting perspectives, which allows people to interpret their own view: multidimensional nature of the characters: “there is always another side (82)”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>This part is in the POV of Grace Poole</li>
<li>Antoinette is being kept in the attic of her husband’s house against her will with Grace Poole</li>
<li>Later, the narration switches back to Antoinette’s consciousness and Grace Poole tells her that Richard Mason visited, and that Antoinette attacked him with a knife</li>
</ul>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<ol>
<li>Antoinette’s husband (Rochester)
<ul>
<li>Rochester sleeps with Amelie as he feels alienated with Antoinnette</li>
<li>Christiphone uses Obeah to make Rochester desire Antoinette, but it only had little effect</li>
<li>hough he got sexually attracted to her, he still sleeps with Amelie as he <strong>suspects</strong> Antoinette – he is <strong>vindictive</strong> as he knows he’s been messed with, and he is also very <strong>manipulative</strong></li>
<li>We learn that he has been manipulated by his father in marrying Antoinette, he did not have a choice in this decision
<ul>
<li>This makes the readers sympathize for him, but his later actions on Antoinette show that he is inhuman</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He is quite critical of Antoinette’s beauty and objectifies her: he breaks down every component of her face and looks at her with hatred
<ul>
<li>He also says that her beauty is a “trick of the light”, showing that he only finds her beautiful at specific times of the day</li>
<li>He also feels that she is manipulative, as she used Obeah to make him love her</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Antoinette
<ul>
<li>She is going crazy, just like her mother, and her death is also foreshadowed by her husband: “I drew the sheet over her gently as if I covered a dead girl”; it also states that he marriage satisfaction is dead</li>
<li>She is unsure about how much time passes as she is going crazy after being alone</li>
<li>The fact that she doesn't remember attacking Richard Mason with a knife shows that she is losing consciousness
<ul>
<li>She cannot remember her violent actions and believes that she didn't recognize Richard Mason</li>
<li>She also said that she saw a girl in a white dress and thought it was a ghost; this is most likely Jane Eyre</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The red dress reminds her of the relationship she had with Sandi Cosway</li>
<li>She drops the red dress
<ul>
<li>When it spreads like fire, she is one step closer to what she wishes to do</li>
<li>The color red symbolizes her passion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She steals Grace’s keys to explore the house</li>
<li>She has everything taken away from her
<ul>
<li>She cannot even please Rochester as she ever sees him again</li>
<li>She does not have a mirror to see how she herself looks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the end, she has a dream about setting the house to fire, climbing on top, then jumping to her death
<ul>
<li>This reminds her of the fire in the Coulibri</li>
<li>When she wakes up, she decides to act out her dream, although it is unclear</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dreams: again, the dream foreshadows what will truly happened</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grace Poole
<ul>
<li>She narrates the first part of Part 3
<ul>
<li>She seems to be an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong> as she gossips</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She is paid twice as much as any other servant to keep quiet about the “madwoman in the attic”, although she is uncomfortable about Antoinette’s conditions
<ul>
<li>However, she often falls asleep, allowing Antoinette to take her keys and roam around the house</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She was also in Jane Eyre</li>
<li>She says: “the world outside…can be a black and cruel world to a woman”; where <strong>black</strong> is a reference to one of Antoinette's dreams, where she was being chased by a man “black with hatred”</li>
<li>Unlike Christophine, she only takes care of her for money; she subdied her for money
<ul>
<li>Christophine, on the other hand was more concerned for Antoinette; she awsa s supporting mother figure for her</li>

<li>When Grace Poole lit a fire, Antoinette admires its beauty and wonders why she was locked in the attic
<ul>
<li>At this point, her narration is hazy and she only observes things that happen around her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fire is both destructive and redemptive in the novel
<ul>
<li>In both cases, it was used to rebel too: first the slaves rebelled against the Cosway family, then Antoinette rebelled against her husband</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Antoinette’s dream was in a way <strong>foreshadowed</strong> by** Coco flying into the flames**
<ul>
<li>The wings area symbol of <strong>independence</strong>, and Antoinette did not have any, so she thought that she was better off dead</li>
<li>Through suicide she gains freedom and betrays Rochester</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Red dress
<ul>
<li>The red dress triggers many memories (that were left out earlier in the narration) for Antoinette
<ul>
<li>For example, her and Sandi’s relation: he also asked her if she wanted to elope and they often kissed</li>
<li>She does not share this with Grace Poole, reinforcing her distrust of her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Her red dress comes in stark contrast to the white dress of the white girl she saw (Jane Eyre)
<ul>
<li>The dress symbolizes passion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Similarities between Rochester and Antoinette
<ul>
<li>Both are delusional and both were neglected at childhood and then forced to marry; both like rum – it allowed them to escape reality</li>
<li>They were alcoholics as they did not have work at the plantation because no more slaves, so the only thing to do was drink. This created a state of disarray as the transition from slaves to no slaves was very abrupt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Marriage
<ul>
<li>There is some hypocrisy: Rochester received money as a dowry in marrying Antoinette, while Amelie paid Rochester money to have sex with him</li>
<li>The first one is socially acceptable and the other one is socially unacceptable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names
<ul>
<li>After starting at the tapestry hanging on her wall for a long time, she starts seeing her mother, but doesn't tell Grace about it – she is hallucinating and slowly losing her sanity
<ul>
<li>She feels disconnected from her identity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She also notes that “Grace” does not fit Grace Poole, and seems to have a distrust of her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Antoinette’s death; shouting Tia
<ul>
<li>When she jumps into the fire, she decides to shout Tia’s name</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>More notes</h1>
<h2>Slavery</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Wide Sargasso Sea, the Emancipation act led to the freedom of the slaves</li>
<li>But slavery also exists between husband and wife, as seen by Antoinette and her husband: this is a different type of slavery</li>
<li>Slavery also extends to post-colonial slavery
<ul>
<li>Antoinette’s husband tells Christophe that he will turn her for her Obeah practices</li>
<li>This suppression continues even after the Emancipation act</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Burning of houses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Two houses burned down in the novel</li>
<li>The burning of the houses is a symbolism and parallelism
<ul>
<li>First the slaves burned the house to avenge themselves</li>
<li>It is implied that Antoinette, at the end of the novel, burns her husband’s house down to escape
<ul>
<li>She killed herself in the process, so she lays down her life in the hope to be free and destroy her husband</li>
<li>She shows her agency by doing this</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Antoinette’s agency</h2>
<ul>
<li>She tries to</li>
</ul>
<h1>Themes</h1>
<h2>Identity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Antoinette does not fit in anywhere as she is a creole English
<ul>
<li>She is neither Jamaican nor from England, so she feels like an outsider, and others also treat her like one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chrisophone, on the other hand is portrayed as Caribbean, while Antoinette does not fit it anywhere</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slavery and freedom</h2>
<ul>
<li>Conflict is created between the newly emancipated slaves and their owners
<ul>
<li>Their interactions lead to the bringdown of the Coulibri</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Power</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chrisotophone has access to Obeah</li>
<li>Rochester has the power to change Antoinette’s name</li>
</ul>
<h2>Money</h2>
<h2>Women and power</h2>
<ul>
<li>The female characters in Wide Sargasso Sea were confronted by societal forces that prevent them from acting and sustaining themselves</li>
<li>The only socially acceptable ways for a woman to attain security were marriage and entering the convert</li>
<li>In Annette’s case, the marriage destroyed not only hers, but also her children’s lives
<ul>
<li>Alexander Cosway, the first husband had many affairs publicly, and therefore many bastard children</li>
<li>When he died, he left the family destitute</li>
<li>He ignored her pleas to move out, which ended up killing Pierre and causing her to descend to madness</li>
<li>Antoinette was forced to marry Rochester by Mr Mason for money: this marriage was only done for financial benefit to Rochester and Mr Mason; he essentially sold her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rochester sleeps with Amelie, without making any effort to hide it from Antoinette, while still on their honeymoon</li>
<li>The female characters who embody strength and agency are those who decide to remain outside the control of men/husbands
<ul>
<li>One example is Christophone
<ul>
<li>Christophine was respected in her community for her expertise in Obeah, and Antoinette also depended on her</li>
<li>She states that “Women must have spunks to live in this wicked world”, and ““All women, all colours, nothing but fools. Three children I have. One living in this world, each one a different father, but no husband, I thank my God. I keep my money. I don’t give it to no worthless man”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Auto Cora is a widow who does not remarry
<ul>
<li>She was relatively stable, and able to control her health and movements</li>
<li>She also promises safety for Antoinette</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Amelie is a minor character who also demonstrates that power can be with those outside traditional marriages
<ul>
<li>She manipulates sex to exercise to gain control over her employers, so she sleeps with and receives money from Rochester</li>
<li>She also says that she plans to move to Rio to continue the same tactic: “She wanted to go to Rio. There were rich men in Rio”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Horror novel</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wide Sargasso Sea explores ideas of domestic abuse and cruelty</li>
<li>For example, rochester renames Antoinette
<ul>
<li>Antoinette first has a name, then it is taken from her. This shows how she lost her identity to the unnamed character</li>
<li>He renames her Bertha, just like a slave-owner renaming its possessions, in order to assert his dominance, and distance himesend from her heritage and alleged madness</li>
<li>He has also taken her money, property, sense of security, emotional happiness, secual dignity, and finally her name</li>
<li>He calls her laugh a “crazy laugh”, which justifies in his delusion, his abuse of her</li>
<li>He also pretends to believe that she has harmed him: “You deceived me, betrayed me”</li>
<li>He also reduced her to a “doll” and a “marionette”, a plaything and object to be manipulated</li>
<li>At the end, he describes her as if he is on the perpetrator of her destruction: “only a ghost … nothing left but hopelessness”</li>
<li>He also makes sure he can never get away from her: “She’s mad but mine … my lunatic. My mad girl”</li>

after the Emancipation Act\n*   Set in Jamaica \n*   Victorian\n*   Literature is response to society of the time time \n\n\n## Jean Rhys (author)\n\n\n\n*   Struggled with being an actor as she was ostracized for her Caribbean heritage and accent, and eventually taken out from school\n*   She became a writer during the “first-wave” feminism period\n\n\n## _Jane Eyre_\n\n\n\n*   This was one of the earliest **feminist **books\n    *   It had to be published under a male pseudonym for that reason\n*   The story follows closely the life of the author, Charlotte Bronte\n*   Wide Sargasso Sea is based on this book\n    *   The author of Wide Sargasso Sea felt that Bertha (Antoinette in Wide Sargasso Sea) was not portrayed in the best way possible\n*   The symbol of the **fire** is there in both books; it is a symbol of freedom\n    *   In Jane Eyre, Bertha commits suicide with fire\n    *   The symbol fire connects the two books, but the differences in perspectives and the husband unnamed keeps the two books apart and makes Wide Sargasso Sea its own story by giving Antoinette and identity (which was destroyed by the end)\n\n\n## SIgnificance of the title\n\n\n\n*   The **sea** is a symbol to **isolation** referring to Antoinette\n*   It is a sea which is in between many others, and from the outside, they all look the same, almost indistinguishable\n    *   However, Antoinette’s problems, although they might look common, are in fact very destructive\n    *   Not many people understood her problems\n*   This is similar to Antoinette, most people think she has the same problems as everyone else, but her problems are more important: also, from the outside her problems really cannot be seen, only when we zoom in we can see them\n*   The sea is also covered in seaweed and is unusually calm in the Bermuda triangle\n    *   Covered in seaweed shows the concealment, how her feelings were quite literally locked up (because of neglect by her mother)\n    *   Bermuda triangle is a place of conflict as it was believed to be a place of destruction\n*   The fact that it is “Wide” shows the big gap between the two ways of life of the colonizers and the creoles\n    *   Antoinette is figuratively in between Jamaica and England\n    *   She is neither colonial nor Jamaican, she is a white creole\n*   Although Antonette marries a colonizer, there is a difference in perspectives, priorities are too wide open and different, and there is not actual union between them\n    *   Antoinette’s husband is english while Antoinette is a woman whose identity is framed by her creole nature, and her ways are different from his, and so she was not accepted by locals\n    *   So the “**wide**” sea also represents a physical and geographical separation\n\n\n# Narrators\n\n\n\n*   The novel follows a complicated narrative strategy with **multiple perspectives**\n    *   If we only saw Antoinette’s perspective, we will see her as a **biased** and **unreliable narrator**\n    *   However, we see a more **holistic view** of her and how she has been affected through the different perspectives, which bring out the different facets of her character\n*   This comes in contrast to the single narrative in _Jane Eyre_; _Wide Sargasso Sea_ is in **response** to that book\n    *   _Wide Sargasso Sea_ provides an explanation for why the madwoman exists in the first place\n    *   In _Jane Eyre_, there is only one narrative account in her name, and although she was marginalized for being poor, she didn't suffer from the racial implications\n    *   For her, the madwoman is just crazy, and she doesn’t go into details to why she is mad\n        *   To JE, the madwoman (Antoinette) is a villain in her happiness\n        *   So JR provides multiple reasons why the “madwomen” even exists, and why she is locked up\n\n\n## Part 1: Antoinette\n\n\n\n*   In Jane Eyre, Bertha Mason’s story is told from the perspective of the narrator, Jane Eyre, who views her as the ‘madwomen’\n*   In this novel, she gets to voice her own experience\n*   In the story, we see her change from child to adolescent\n\n\n### Unreliable narrator \n\n\n\n*   The narration makes the readers feel “closer” to the storyteller as she expressed her inner thoughts, feelings, and also dreams however this makes us as the readers less critical and blind to her faults as it is easier to sympathize for her\n*   Her story is full of gaps and silence, and also secrets\n    *   There are certain parts of the story she chooses not to disclose\n\n\n### Stream of consciousness\n\n\n\n*   Allows the mingling of a child’s perspective to the older narrator's memories\n*   As she watches Pierre sleep, she reflects on Mr Mason’s plans, the future, and the bamboos\n*   All these descriptions come in sharp contrast to the events yet to come\n*   At the beginning, most of the events happen in order but later, it is left to the readers understand as if they are a part of the story\n*   Stream of consciousness also reflects on her uncertainties: this is seen through her lack of traditional sentence structures, and lack of formal dialogues\n    *   Her thoughts are **disjointed** as there are gaps in understanding and narration\n*   She is only recollecting various disconnected thoughts, and sharing her personal thoughts: this gives the reader a glimpse into her mind as she does not share everything\n*   There are many gaps in the narrative (makes her an **unreliable narrator**)\n    *   One gap was after the burning down of the Coulibri\n        *   The gap shows that she feels shocked and is in a state of bewilderment or fear\n    *   There was a minor gap after Annett asks her whose dress she was wearing\n\n\n## Part 2: Antoinette’s husband\n\n\n\n*   Her husband also receives his own point of view and in the story this allows for\n    *   Different points of view on his experienced and relathips offered to readers\n    *   Readers to feel closer to his experience, and not only Antoinette’s\n*   Similar to Antoinette, he also has dislocated experienced of\n    *   New cultural experienced\n    *   Intense sensual effects of the world\n    *   Sexual passion\n    *   Memory and relations with family\n*   JR uses a range of narrative techniques for representing the confused responses to the world and people around him\n*   His first person narrative is manipulated to reveal is precarious sense of his own identity\n*   The setting is **overwhelming** to him, and he feels disconnected\n\n\n### Stream of consciousness\n\n\n\n*   His stream of consciousness makes the novel **less** **biased**, and it introduces the idea of Antoinette’s voice being **muted**, which is further emphasized by the setting change (England, a place Antoinette doesn't feel comfortable in)\n*   There are often differences in what he things and what he says\n*   He has many cultural confusions\n*   He does not understand the colonizers\n\n\n### Daniel cosway\n\n\n\n*   He provides many of the details Antoinette never told Rochester\n*   However, he does not mention the fire at the Coulibri that lead to Annette's grief and hence madness\n*   He is therefore an **unreliable narrator** \n\n\n## Part 3: Grace Poole and Antoinette\n\n\n\n*   The first italicized part is by Grace Poole, Antoinette’s jailer\n*   The second part is narrated by Antoinette, who is now the “madwoman in the attic”\n*   She employs **stream of consciousness** through inner monologue\n\n\n### Other\n\n\n\n*   Other characters are also given their own stories, although not through first-person narratives\n*   We only hear their voice through dialogs, letters\n\n\n### Annette\n\n\n\n*   We get Antoinette’s memories of her, her dialogs reported by Antoinette, gossip and comments of servants and other family members, and information given to Rochester by Daniel Cosway And Christophine\n*   Her descriptions can be contradictory as Antoinette is an **unreliable narrator**\n*   Antoinette doesn't describe her mother’s decline until she is forced to explain her family history to Rochester in Part 2\n    *   This also shows that they were never close (expanded below)\n\n\n### Aunt Cora and Mr Mason\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette’s memories, speech and dialog, gossip\n*   We also get conflicted opinions of them\n\n\n### White community\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette’s speech often slips into recounting local white gossip about her family\n*   This method of narration ensures that the voice remains hers, but also reveals the values and attitudes of the white community to which she belongs\n\n\n### Christophine\n\nHer character is constructed from\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette’s first person narrative: her importance as an influence is demonstrated by the amount of attention she is given in Antoinette’s memories\n    *   Her appearance, manner, and personality are carefully described early in Part 1.\n*   Gossip and fragments of dialog retold by Antoinette reveal the attitudes of other people\n*   Rochester’s POV: he initially sees her as a servant, but he ends up treating her with hostility once he suspects her of using obeah practices on him\n    *   Although the part is narrated by Rochester, she is given her own voice by inserting sections of dialog, in which she confronts Rochester in a very dramatic way.\n*   Letter from Mr Frazer to Rochester: we see an opinion on her held by the judicial element within the white community\n\n\n### Daniel Cosway\n\nHe is represented within Rochester's first person narration\n\n\n\n*   Letters; he sends two letters to Rochester in which he presents his perspective on Antoinette’s family background, which Fuels Rochester's suspensions about insanity\n*   Dialog: his speech is reported by Rochester\n    *   He can command in different styles of speech with rhetorical and biblical resonances\n    *   He modulates into more natural styles of speech later\n    *   However, his dialog is presented by Rochester, and is therefore colored by his perspective.\n*   He is also an **unreliable narrator**\n\n\n### Black servants and the blacks\n\n\n\n*   Mainly reported through speech and dialog in Antoinette’s narration\n*   The wider black community is notably silent in the novel\n\n\n# Structure\n\n\n\n*   There are two main narrators: **Antoinette’s husband** (unnamed) and **Antoinette**, creating a duality of antagonist and protagonist: this creates dichotomy as both are protagonists during the time they narrate the story\n*   This dichotomy creates a **contrast** in personality, themes, and cultures\n\n\n## Conflict of cultures and characters\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette is part of the West Indies culture while Rochester comes from a patriarchal, colonial power\n*   We see the differences in their ideologies: Antoinette likes nature and prefers to be in the garden while Rochester says: “I hated the mountains and the hills, the rivers and the rain. I hated the sunsets of whatever colour, I hated its beauty and it’s magic and the secret I would never know.” Whatever Antoinette describes evokes sympathy and emotion, while Rochester finds the sun and vibrant colors overwhelming: he does not understand interrelations of black and white\n\n\n## Contrast of themes\n\n\n\n*   Need to finish\n\n\n## Why is the book divided into different parts?\n\n\n\n*   To show the flow of time: from childhood, to adolescence, and then a sudden shift to marriage\n*   To show a shift in her mental status\n    *   To show that she tries to find security, but fails to do so\n        *   In Part 2, she tries to find security, but fails to do so\n\n\n### Sympathies\n\n\n\n*   In Part 1, we are sympathetic to Antoinette\n*   In Part 2, we are still sympathetic towards her\n    *   But we get to know her story through her husband, so it is counter-intuitive that we do not sympathize for the narrator\n    *   Although we see all his thoughts and motives, we don't sympathize for him\n    *   Even after known that he a victim of parental influence and manipulation (forced marriage), we don't sympathize for him\n\n\n# Part 1\n\n\n\n*   Narrated by Antoinette; she describes her childhood\n*   There is little flow in the stories with many skips between events as she recollects; one event does not lead to another\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n## Characters\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette\n    *   Her childhood experiences have shaped her character: she receives no comfort or love from her mother, and is **mocked in the society for her origins**, something she cannot control\n        *   She is constantly compared to her mother too (in a bad way), which is, again, something which is out of reach: “Look the crazy girl, you like your mother … She have eyes like zombi and you have eyes like zombi too”\n        *   This also foreshadows that she will end up like her mother\n        *   It also shows that others don't see her as a human being because she is of a different race.\n    *   Her one true friend or solace she found ended up joining the society in mocking her after stealing from her\n        *   This, in a way, caused her to be determined to be away from people, as she was neglected, and Tia betrayed her\n        *   We found out early on that her mother was not fond of her as she ignored her and seldom talked to her, so Antoinette gradually started to avoid people\n    *   Similar to the Garden (symbol), she was **left (neglected) to grow wild**, with no care or guidance\n        *   She was rejected by her mother\n        *   She also states that the company of the grasses was “better, better than people” – it is clear that she was **neglected** as a child\n    *   After the remarriage, she finds her own home **alienating** as she has a new fear of Christophine and her practices of Obeah, although she grew up trusting her\n        *   This fear is based off of gossip she hears in the wedding, and she is struggling to determine what is true\n        *   We feel sympathetic towards her as she feels unsafe in her own home\n    *   After her dress is stolen by Tia, Christophine argues with Annette about how she doesn't have any more dresses: “She run wild, she grow up worthless. And nobody care”\n    *   She is highly emotional and easily feels afraid and hatred, but learns to conceal it after numerous traumatic incidents in her life\n        *   She was forced to conceal her fears and emotions as she was neglected\n    *   She often decides not to talk about certain ideas: she decides not to verbalize certain things in the hope that they are not true\n        *   When the horse died, and when they became “marooned”, she did not tell anyone in the hope that it was not true\n        *   Also, when Mr Mason mentions a suitor, she gets a feeling of insecurity as she will lose her freedom, but she decides to ignore it in the hope that ignoring it will make it disappear\n            *   she understands the **suffocating** truths of marriage, as she has seen them in her mother\n2. Annette\n    *   Antoinette spends most of her early narration describing her mother, and see her progression from a beautiful Creole women who is ostracized by the society to a quite “thin” women who has lost any hope to live\n    *   She finally descends to madness after the fire, and learning that Pierre is dead; she loses all hopes and fears and to her death is the best way out\n        *   She has become disconnected from herself and her emotions as she has lost everything: her husband, her status (after the Emancipation act), and her son, so she chooses her ignore her family and try to escape it. \n    *   We see her signs of instability when she “speaks aloud to herself”, although the arrival of the Luttrell's gives her a new hope\n    *   She is never able to reconnect with Antoinette and wants to leave the past behind\n    *   The fact that her death/funeral is not described in detail shows the distance between Antoinette and Annette\n        *   We actually only understands what happens to the mother when she described it to Rochester; this shows the disconnect between Antoinette and her mother\n        *   Information about her that is unrevealed comes to readers through gossip, such as her death\n        *   This shows that Antoinette thought that it wasn't important anymore as she neglected her so much during childhood – their disconnect is clear\n    *   She foreshadows her daughter’s future as she goes insane as a result of what her husband did\n        *   The similarity between their names also foreshadows that they will have similar lives.\n    *   We later learn in Part 2 that she was sexualy abused by the caretakesr, but Antoinette was unable to mention it because of the trauma she was going through\t\n        *   She also refused to describe it in the hopes that it did not actually happen\n        *   The caretakers were black, and shows a role reversal as usually the white slave owners would force sexual relationships with the black slaves before emancipation\n3. Christophine\n    *   She is the one person who stands by Antoinette’s side, and she teaches her the importance of her Creole heritage and to be proud of it through her songs\n    *   She herself expresses her heritage boldy through the way she dresses, but still tries to fit in by maintaining her accent\n    *   She is feared by the locals as she practises obeah\n    *   “She was your father's wedding present”: she was a freed slave, and she shows loyalty to Annette and her family and does not abandon them\n    *   She is very close to Anette, she even says “Some people say/think [Annette] crazy” when Annette does not understand how poor they are\n        *   This also suggests the intimacy of their relationship\n    *   After the coulibri is renovated, Antoinette has a new fear of her due to obeah\n        *   Because of this and the new servants combined with her neglecting mother, she finds her new home very alienating.\n4. Tia\n    *   She is the representative of the society to Antoinette\n    *   Before making friends with Antoinette, she insulted her\n    *   When Antoinette decides to go live with her, Tia throws a rock at her forehead, showing that she was never accepted by her\n    *   She bettered Antoinette in greed for money and through of her as a “white nigger”; she also taunts Antoinette by saying “we ate salt fish”\n        *   She means to say that because Antoinette is so poor, she cannot afford fresh fish\n    *   She could be one of the driving forces in Antoinette’s life because she constantly mentions her name (in dreams and later in the book)\n    *   She stole Antoinette's clothes and hence her identity\n    *   Although they got along, money drew them apart again\n        *   The childish bet and disagreement reflects the socio-economic disparity between the whites and the blacks\n        *   The fact the Tia steals Antoinette’s dress and her money highlights the symbolic significance of appearance and attire in female power and security in the novel.\n5. Mr Mason\n    *   He is a representative of the white slave owners, a wealthy plantation owner\n    *   He portrays the theme of ignorance as he does not take Annette seriously about moving out; he is self-centered as he wants to make more money\n        *   He does not see Annette’s point of view because he does not understand racial relations on the island (similar to Rochester)\n    *   He is a new breed of the white men as he is cunning and bends laws to fit them to his liking: although the Emancipation Act ended the reign of slave owners, neo-colonialism takes place\n    *   Although Annette has no money, he still married her because he found her beautiful, but when he discovers that she is mentally ill, he locks her up in inhuman conditions\n        *   The fact that Annette and Antoinette are similar foreshadows that even Antoinette will end up in similar conditions\n        *   Sending Antoinette to be married can be similar to being locked up as she is sent against her will as she did not get a choice\n        *   In the end, she ended up getting locked up too: both their lives ended in similar ways\n    *   He has a dislike towards Aunt Cora as she did not help their family during the time of need (find page)\n        *   Furthermore, she was a successful woman, and saying that he dislikes her makes him superior as he is a man and hence he holds more power.\n    *   He misunderstands the locals and does not understand how dangerous they can be: “They're too damn lazy to be dangerous”, “They are children––they wouldn't hurt a fly”, “handful of drunken negroes”\n6. Pierre\n    *   He “staggered when he walked and couldn't speak distinctly”; he is mentally disabled \n    *   He is later described as an idiot to Rochester by Daniel Cosway the bastard\n        *   Rochester thought that the disease was genetic when it was not, so he thought Antoinette was also crazy like him\n        *   This can be linked to ADH: Dr. Rank’s diseases\n    *   Annette “changed” after hearing the doctor about Pierre’s conditions, suggesting that it was an incurable disease, that was likely a burden for the family\n7. Mr Luttrell\n    *   Kills his dog and goes to the sea never to come back\n        *   He has no money\n        *   After the Emancipation Act, he had nothing\n        *   He is a white male who was lost\n    *   He was in a state of despair following the Emancipation Act\n    *   His death sets the mood for the rest of the events, the mood of **despair and disillusionment**\n    *   His death gives Antoinette the troubled ideas of freedom\n8. Sandi Cosway\n    *   She is Antoinette’s black cousin: “I knew who he was, his name was Sandi, Alexander Cosway’s son. Once I would have said ‘my cousin Sandi’ but Mr Mason’s lectures had made me shy about my coloured relatives”\n    *   Mr Mason and his Superior Englishman attitude influenced Antoinette with Sandi Cosway\n        *   Antoinette understood that Mr Mason would not accept any friendship/relationship between her and Sandi\n        *   Mr Mason disliked Antoinette’s creole family (including Aunt Cora)\n        *   Mr Mason is also representative of the English society and their mindset, so the difference in skin color is a barrier that keeps the two apart: this social barrier is heavily linked to racial differences, which had heightened during this time period after the Emancipation Act\n\n\n## Themes\n\n\n\n1. Isolation and ostracizing based on races, and racial discrimination; alienation\n    *   Creoles are seen as being in between as they are not black or white, and are therefore not accepted in the society\n    *   Antoinette refers to non-creoles using the word “**they**” showing a disconnect and clear distinction between the two; this word is used quite early on in the novel suggestion animosity between blacks and whites in Jamaica\n    *   The fact that the family had to “[persuade] a Spanish Town doctor to visit” Pierre demonstrates the tension between the whites and blacks\n    *   The racial hierarchy in the 1830s in Jamaica was complex and strained with tensions between whites and creoles\n        *   There was resentment which lead to hatred and violence such as the Cosways being referred to as “**white cockroaches**”, and eventually being driven away from their homes from their former selves\n        *   These dynamics are also complicated by exclusion based on race, geographical origin, appearance, wealth, and status.\n    *   Major characters in the novel are defined by their inclusion or exclusion from cultural groups\n        *   Although Antoinette and the Cosways where white, they were not the dominant group of Jamaica as they were creoles.\n    *   Alienation leads to the characters of the novel being destructive too: Anette, driven by her family’s exclusions from white society, seeks marriage to Mr Mason, and this ultimately leads to the loss of her son and hence her sanity.\n    *   From the beginning, we see that Antoinette’s family is dysfunctional, and she is quite isolated because of this\n    *   The love marriage of Cosway was not happy as he had many bastard children with other women\n2. Internal isolation from family and neglect\n    *   This is one of the most prominent themes in the novel, and highly relates to Antoinette: she was constantly neglected from her mother, whose voice was neglected by Mr Mason\n    *   It was because of neglect that Annette was cast as an outsider, which leads to her mental breakdown\n3. Effect of the Emancipation Act on the society\n    *   The Emancipation Act of 1833 leaves discontent and violence as seen in Mr Luttrell, a white former slave owner, who commited suicide as he was unable to adjust to the new social and economic landscape.\n    *   Although the Emancipation Act freed slaves, slave owners suffered as shown by the Cosway family. For example, at Coulibri, the local population of black former slaves are deeply angry. Antoinette also says “They hated us”. She was also called a “white cockroach, go away, go away. Nobody want you”\n4. Ignorance and money, the reason Mr Mason did not want to leave\n5. Women and power\n    *   Annette wanted to leave the Coulibri, but was unable to as she couldn't convince Mr Mason\n        *   Similar to how the bird’s wings were clipped, she has a lack of independence in the marriage: the bird’s wings are a metaphor for her independence which is being diminished by Mr Mason\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n\n1. The garden\n    *   The garden at the Coulibri is a symbol of life, or eventually Antoinette as it too runs wild because it is uncared for\n    *   Antoinette finds comfort in the moss of the garden and enjoys wondering about the unexplored areas\n        *   She was **forced** to find comfort in the garden because she was **neglected** by annette, her mother.\n    *   Although she finds beauty in the overgrown orchids, she is afraid to go near them\n    *   Different parts of the garden may present her qualities and her desires\n    *   Antoinette described the garden with many bright colors: “green, white, purple”; she loves these colors and mentions them many times, while Rochester dislikes them and prefers brown and white instead\n    *   “Snakey” looking is a biblical allusion to the snake, which is likely overgrown?\n2. Fire\t\n    *   In the novel, fire represents **freedom and rebellion** (Part 1, page 21, 22, and the end of Part 3)\n    *   The ex-slaves set fire to the Coulibri as an act of **defiance** after being free following the Emancipation Act\n    *   “So black and white, they burn the same, eh? (23)”: this, in a way, unites the whites and the blacks\n    *   Furthermore, at the end of the play, it is suggested that Antoinette committed suicide with fire. In Jane Eyre, Antoinette (Bertha) commits suicide with fire, hence it symbolizes her **rebellion** in order to escape her husband\n3. Hair\n    *   It is a symbol of the female characters’ agency and identity\n    *   At the time of the fire, Annette’s mother had disheveled hair, showing that she is not taken seriously and that her identity doesn't mean anything to Mr Mason\n    *   The fact that Antoinette’s hair has been cut without her knowledge foreshadows that she will slowly lose her identity and agency (This is true because her husband gives her a new name, Bertha, hence she loses her identity, and she also loses her freedom and has to follow her husband's orders)\n        *   Her identity is also being lost as she has lost her father and brother, and her mother is soon to die. \n    *   Eventually, Rochester calls her Bertha, which is not her real name\n        *   This is shows that she has lost her identity\n4. Clothes\n    *   Symbolizes wealth, but only temporary in Part 1\n    *   Clothes and money are divided: as Tia steals the dress\n    *   Link to ADH: the **tarantella dress** is symbol/motif and is linked to **objectification** of women\n    *   However, the removal of dresses in ADH heads to empowerment for the women while it is (bad for Antoinette)\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n1. Beginning racism\n    *   It is a powerful opening beginning with racism: “the Jamaican ladies had never approved of my mother” – the beginning shows that they were excluded socially\n        *   Many people had criticized her mother for being a widow\n        *   This shows that in order for women to be successful, they had to have a man as they had a **lack of agency**\n    *   The fallout between Tia and Antoinette was because of a racial tension, and it also foreshadows the relation with her husband\n2. Women and agency\n    *   Women with a husband/partner have a lack of agency when compared to those who decided not to marry\n    *   This is evident in the case of Annette: she married twice and has a lack of agency and ends up being locked up\n3. Antoinette’s many dreams (pages 11 and 34)\n    *   Dreams are prevalent in Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea, in which they give us views of expressed and **unexpressed emotions**, and they **foreshadow** certain events\n    *   Dreams in Wide Sargasso Sea contain **parallel imagery** to the dreams of Jane Eyre; the dreams on Antoinette are **clairvoyant** like Jane’s dreams, which reflect on a part of her consciousness\n    *   In the novel, Antoinette has three dreams which are essentially of the same event, and they give us insight onto Antoinette’s maturing character and provide foreshadow\n    *   The first dream is in her childhood when Tia steals her pennies and dress: “I dreamed that I was walking in the forest. Not alone. Someone who hated me was with me, out of sight. I could hear heavy footsteps coming closer and though I struggled and screamed, I could not move. I woke crying.” \n        *   This reflects on the young Antoinette's **undeveloped sense of self-awareness**\n        *   The fact that it is in the **past tense** suggests that Antoinette is distances from her dream consciousness, and the vagueness of the threat in her dream suggests that she herself does not understand her fears\n        *   “Safe from the strangers”\n            *   Unknown what she is scared of\n            *   Does not understand her fears\n            *   Rudimentary dream which develops later\n    *   Both Antoinette’s and Jane’s dreams are recurring: Antoinette had her “bad dream” again at the age of seventeen when Mr Mason tells her that he is arranging for suitors to visit her\n    *   “Again I have left the house at Coulibri. It is still night and I am walking towards the forest. I am wearing a long dress and thin slippers, so I walk with difficulty, following the man who is with me and holding up the skirt of my dress. It is white and beautiful and I don't wish to get it soiled. I follow him, sick with fear but I make no effort to save myself; if anyone were to try to save me, I would refuse. This must happen. Now we have reached the forest. We are under the tall dark trees and there is no wind. \"Here?\" He turns and looks at me, his face black with hatred, and when I see this I begin to cry. He smiles slyly. \"Not here, not yet,\" he says, and I follow him, weeping. Now I do not try to hold up my dress, it trails in the dirt, my beautiful dress. We are no longer in the forest but in an enclosed garden surrounded by a stone wall and the trees are different trees. I do not know them. There are steps leading upwards. It is too dark to see the wall or the steps, but I know they are there and I think, \"It will be when I go up these steps. At the top.\" I stumble over my dress and cannot get up. I touch a tree and my arms hold on to it. 'Here, here.' But I think I will not go any further. The tree sways and jerks as if it is trying to throw me off. Still I cling and the seconds pass and each one is a thousand years. \"Here, in here,\" a strange voice said, and the tree stopped swaying and jerking. [34]”\n        *   Stream of consciousness\n        *   Unlike the first dream, this second one occurs in the present tense, suggesting that the problems are more [present], and that she has grown closer to her dream consciousness\n        *   Furthermore, the plot of the second dream is more **clear**, suggesting greater **intelligence and perception**, whereas the first one is **vague** with terms such as: “walking in the forest” with “someone who hated me”\n            *   She understands that there is a “man” who is “black with hatred”\n            *   This could show how she is maturing and hence understands her problems much better.\n        *   The fact that she attempts to keep the dress unsoiled demonstrates her concern with maintaining sexual purity\n            *   It also shows that she is submissive towards him, which she is (in the future)\n        *   This dream foreshadows the problems she will soon face with Rochester: the pure dress represents a wedding dress and the man with “hatred” represents Rochester, and her reluctance to join him symbolizes her reluctance to join Rochester\n        *   Later in the book, she blindly listens to Rochester and performs sexual intimacy (she “masochistically and insistently lays herself on [the] sexual altar” and complies to all his orders) and “[makes] no effort to save [herself]”\n        *   “Smile slyly”: Rochester, stays with her just to maintain property and money, shows how detrimental marriage is to her\n        *   She trips on dress and unable to get up = marriage (wedding trap) traps her and is detrimental to her\n4. Antoinette's safety\n    *   She never finds safety: her house on fire, unsafe marriage, improvement in England non-existent\n    *   She was unsafe because she was unloved as a daughter (because of her gender)\n    *   Discrimination also haunts her\n    *   Women could only gain security through marriage or the convent school\n        *   The convent was quite patriarchal, and Antoinette struggled to adjust there\n        *   She struggled to fit as the convert was based off of religion, which is opposed to black magic, which she grew up with Christophine\n        *   Therefore, the convent creates an identity crisis\n        *   Antoinette learns that women must be with men at the convent school, and she is trained to be a good wife: this relates to the theme of **women and freedom** as women had to live their life being in control of men, by learning how to please them\n        *   Antoinette knows that marriage means a loss in freedom as she will be controlled by her husband\n            *   She decides not to talk to anyone about this in the hope that it is not true\n\n\n## Quotes\n\n\n\n1. Garden better, better than people: Antoinette\n    *   She says this after Tia Leaves her\n    *   Link to the \n\n\n# Part 2\n\n\n## Characters\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette\n    *   She feels **isolation** because she cannot connect emotionally to her husband, and also because of **interracial differences** as she belongs to creoles of french\n    *   She is forced to turn to Christophone for protection when she’s scared\n        *   She asks him to make her husband love her using Obeah, but she is unable to (theme of **supernatural**)\n    *   At the end of this Part, she is referred to as a **[Doll](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.9x7rpt4yhono)**\n    *   No one knows why the town is called Massacre and its history, and this foreshadows the **fall of the marriage** and the **loss of identity** of Antoinette\n2. Her husband\n    *   This part is narrated from his **point of view**, and although he is inhuman, his actions are explained by his suffering, confusion and feelings of alienation\n    *   He is also distant from Antoinette and treats her like a stranger and analyzes her appearance critically (in a bad way)\n        *   He also misunderstands her local culture and considers her language inferior\n        *   His detachment from heirs cleaner, so he critically evaluates her without feeling any emotions for her\n    *   It is also implied that he is detached from her own family\n    *   He carelessly crushes the wedding wreaths: this foreshadows that he will treat the marriage carelessly\t\n    *   When he and her try to connect, the differences are made more clear and his only way to understand her is to compare her to an english girl: she ”might have been any pretty English girl”\n    *   Unlike Antoinette, he feels alienated and threatened by landscape and nature.\n    *   There is a clear difference between his and Antoinette’s structure in terms of emotional expression\n        *   He sees Baptiste looking mournful and finds the Caribbean way of displaying emotions as weak and vulnerable as compared to the English way of hiding and concealing emotions.\n    *   Of the wedding, he only remembers the marble and Antoinette’s **cold hands** (“It was cold as ice in the hot sun (47)”), suggesting that he feels no love of feelings/emotions for her at all\n    *   One reason why he is **disoriented** and dislikes Antoinette with passion is because for him, she is emblematic of the Jamaican landscape, which he doesn't not enjoy as he dislikes the landscape and nature, as opposed to Antoinette, who finds comfort in nature.\n    *   After seeing the letter (28), he gets lost in the forest, this can be related to Antoinette's dream\n        *   Unlike Antoinette, he is not well-versed with nature so he gets lost easily\n        *   He also has less of an appeal to other people, so the girl was scared of him, and this is reinforced as he did not even realize/recognize Baptise looking for him, although it could have been because he was quite disoriented\n        *   This comes in stark contrast to Antoinette’s dream at the end of Part 1\n    *   There is sexual tension between him and Amélie, which foreshadows their sexual relationship\n    *   He pities himself, although Antoinette is the bigger victim\n        *   He is able to self-pity as he holds more power in their relationship\n    *   We never see him working; he is living off the money he earned as a slave owner\n    *   He has limited power as compared to other english men as he was the second son\n        *   He had no choice; he was forced to listen to his father\n        *   But he still made his own (bad, incorrect) choices like cheating on Antoinette when he could have been a better husband, so readers do not sympathize for him (even though we see everything from his point of view)\n    *   He wants to care for Antoinette, but decides not to due to his bitter feelings\n        *   He also does not care for the boy who learned English in the hopes of staying with him\n        *   When the boy cries like that, he feels he is crying “for nothing”, reiterating the fact that he shows no remorse\n        *   After a struggle between compassion and bitterness, bitterness has taken over completely\n3. Daniel Cosway\n    *   He is another character similar to Antoinette who has led a life of inherited suffering\n        *   His is likely her half-brother, a result of Cosway and a slave\n    *   While Antoinette is culturally different from everyone else around her, Daniel is racially different as he has a black mother and white father\n    *   Daniel is a bastard son, similar to Antoinette who was rejected as a child by her mother\n    *   Both he and Antoinette share their sense of **isolation, displacement, and anger**\n    *   Letter of page 59: he is spiteful and attacks Antoinette and his and her family by stating how madness runs in the family\t\n        *   There were tensions between emancipated slaves and their owners.\n    *   He wants revenge on Antoinette and the Cosways as his existence was **marginalized**\n        *   He holds them responsible for his situation\n    *   No one is truly sure about his identity and origins\n        *   Even Amélie, who seems to know him is unsure about his real name\n        *   Everyone relies on gossip to know who is truly is\n4. Christophine\n    *   She believes that most women are foolish to rely only on their husbands, so she stays single so that she can stay independent, although she has had three children from different men\n    *   She also has her own money: “I keep my money. I don't give it to no worthless man”\n    *   When Christophine gives Antoinette her inheritance, the wealth now belongs to her husband\n        *   She and Antoinette loses money this way\n        *   She calls Mr Mason “worse than Satan” as he got Antoinette and forced her (sold her) into marrying Rochester\n    *   She is shown to not easily trust people; her distrust is clear\n        *   she does not believe that England exists: “I never see the damn place, how I know?”\n        *   This differentiates her from Antoinette, who relies on trust (she trusts her geography books)\n        *   Christophone treats that place she has never personally experienced with skepticism\n        *   She also does not even trust her own son (Jo-jo) to not leak out what Antoinette and her have been planning: she described him as “Nothing but leaky calabash that boy\"\n    *   She uses obeah to make Rochester love Antoinette again, but ends up fleeing as he knows that she has drugged him\n        *   This gets her in trouble with the law, so she has to leave Antoinette, and cannot help her anymore as she is powerless\n        *   It is Mr Fraser who informs the husband that she is a practitioner of Obeah and considers her dangerous as she has a criminal record\n5. Aunt Cora\n    *   She is shown to be defeated in comparison to Christophine as she “she turned her face to the wall”\n    *   She was unable to help Antoinette escape the control of Mr Mason and Richard Mason, who married her to Rochester to get money\n6. Amélie\n    *   A maid at Granbois who shows no respect for the husband and Antoinette, although she fears Christophone\n    *   She flirtatiously mocks Rochester until he sleeps with her\n    *   She has sex with the husband, and Antoinette is fully aware of it\n        *   Her husband decides to sleep with her just to mess with Antoinette and maker her weaker than she already is\n7. The Young Bull\n    *   His name illustrates his aggressive desire for dominance\n    *   He tries to impress Rochester by showing that he can speak English and demonstrating his knowledge\n\n\n## Themes\n\n\n\n1. Alienation\n    *   Daniel Cosway, a mixed-race illegitimate child of Cosway, wants to gain revenge for everyone marginalizing his existence\n        *   His exclusion from the Cosway family leads to him to write a series of letters to Rochester **maligning** Antoinette and the rest of her family\n    *   These **letters** disturb Rochester and are the **catalyst** for his ultimate distrust and distaste for Antoinette (Link to ADH as paper is [catalyst](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.jx83je1nb652))\n2. Obeah and colonial mindset\n    *   Everyone feared obeah for what it could do\n    *   Antoinette’s husband has a colonial viewpoint, so he distrusted Christophine for her Obeah practices\n    *   Through obeah, Antoinette tries to change her husband\n    *   When the husband knows that he has been manipulated by obeah, he decides to take away Antoinette's **identity** by naming her Bertha\n        *   He attacks her physcologically\n        *   This changing of her name also shows that he holds all the power in the relationship\n        *   It is ironic that an unnamed character is able to strip a named (main) character from her identity so easily; this shows how much power colonial men had (patriarchal society)\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n\n1. Typical white colonists of the time (see Antoinette’s husband remains unnamed in Part 2)\n    *   He is not named, and Rhys generalizes all white colonists to be similar to him\n        *   Rhys wants us to sympathize for Antoinette (even though her husband is the narrator), and she does this by not giving him a name\n    *   Being a colonist, he is a person who ‘extracts what he needs’: for this reason, he disliked nature\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette’s husband remains unnamed\n    *   This is done so that the writer can use his character to represent all typical white colonists – he is symbolic to all of them as he is a perfect example of one\n    *   This is furthered by the fact that he does not work and he only drinks; white colonists would have all the servants do work for them\n    *   Furthermore, the writer only wants to represent the point of view of Antoinette, so giving him a name and hence an identity is difficult and will go against the main point in the novel\n    *   It is deeply **ironic** that the **unnamed** character robbed the main characters of her name and her identity: although he is unnamed, he holds power as he is a man\n    *   He also wants to distance himself from her\n    *   Not giving him a name essentially generalizes him and all other white colonial men\n    *   On the other hand, women are individualized, as Antoinette is given a name and also given more emphasis to as this is a feminist novel\n    *   The story is also mainly through the feminine perspective, and his name is not mentioned so that Antoinette can occupy the center stage\n    *   The fact that he is unnamed also creates a **cold sense of unfamiliarity** which allows to relate with Antoinette as she is also in anew place\n2. The letter from Daniel Cosway\n    *   Antoinette’s husband says that he was expecting the letter, and this shows that he never truly loved her: “I felt no surprise. It was as if I’d expected it, been waiting for it (62)”\n    *   Daniel writes a letter to Rochester stating that he is an illegitimate child of Mr Cosway\n    *   Similar to A Doll’s House, paper is a catalyst\n\n\n# Part 3\n\n\n\n*   Narrated by Grace Poole, a character who gives a **less biased** view of the story\n*   There are shifting perspectives, which allows people to interpret their own view: multidimensional nature of the characters: “there is always another side (82)”\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n\n*   This part is in the POV of Grace Poole\n*   Antoinette is being kept in the attic of her husband’s house against her will with Grace Poole\n*   Later, the narration switches back to Antoinette’s consciousness and Grace Poole tells her that Richard Mason visited, and that Antoinette attacked him with a knife\n\n\n## Characters\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette’s husband (Rochester)\n    *   Rochester sleeps with Amelie as he feels alienated with Antoinnette\n    *   Christiphone uses Obeah to make Rochester desire Antoinette, but it only had little effect\n    *   hough he got sexually attracted to her, he still sleeps with Amelie as he **suspects** Antoinette – he is **vindictive** as he knows he’s been messed with, and he is also very **manipulative**\n    *   We learn that he has been manipulated by his father in marrying Antoinette, he did not have a choice in this decision\n        *   This makes the readers sympathize for him, but his later actions on Antoinette show that he is inhuman\n    *   He is quite critical of Antoinette’s beauty and objectifies her: he breaks down every component of her face and looks at her with hatred\n        *   He also says that her beauty is a “trick of the light”, showing that he only finds her beautiful at specific times of the day\n        *   He also feels that she is manipulative, as she used Obeah to make him love her\n2. Antoinette\n    *   She is going crazy, just like her mother, and her death is also foreshadowed by her husband: “I drew the sheet over her gently as if I covered a dead girl”; it also states that he marriage satisfaction is dead\n    *   She is unsure about how much time passes as she is going crazy after being alone\n    *   The fact that she doesn't remember attacking Richard Mason with a knife shows that she is losing consciousness\n        *   She cannot remember her violent actions and believes that she didn't recognize Richard Mason\n        *   She also said that she saw a girl in a white dress and thought it was a ghost; this is most likely Jane Eyre\n    *   The red dress reminds her of the relationship she had with Sandi Cosway\n    *   She drops the red dress\n        *   When it spreads like fire, she is one step closer to what she wishes to do\n        *   The color red symbolizes her passion\n    *   She steals Grace’s keys to explore the house\n    *   She has everything taken away from her\n        *   She cannot even please Rochester as she ever sees him again\n        *   She does not have a mirror to see how she herself looks \n    *   At the end, she has a dream about setting the house to fire, climbing on top, then jumping to her death\n        *   This reminds her of the fire in the Coulibri\n        *   When she wakes up, she decides to act out her dream, although it is unclear\n    *   Dreams: again, the dream foreshadows what will truly happened\n3. Grace Poole\n    *   She narrates the first part of Part 3\n        *   She seems to be an **unreliable narrator** as she gossips\n    *   She is paid twice as much as any other servant to keep quiet about the “madwoman in the attic”, although she is uncomfortable about Antoinette’s conditions\n        *   However, she often falls asleep, allowing Antoinette to take her keys and roam around the house\n    *   She was also in Jane Eyre\n    *   She says: “the world outside…can be a black and cruel world to a woman”; where **black** is a reference to one of Antoinette's dreams, where she was being chased by a man “black with hatred”\n    *   Unlike Christophine, she only takes care of her for money; she subdied her for money\n        *   Christophine, on the other hand was more concerned for Antoinette; she awsa s supporting mother figure for her\n\n\n## Themes\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n\n1. Fire\n    *   When Grace Poole lit a fire, Antoinette admires its beauty and wonders why she was locked in the attic\n        *   At this point, her narration is hazy and she only observes things that happen around her\n    *   Fire is both destructive and redemptive in the novel\n        *   In both cases, it was used to rebel too: first the slaves rebelled against the Cosway family, then Antoinette rebelled against her husband\n    *   Antoinette’s dream was in a way **foreshadowed** by** Coco flying into the flames**\n        *   The wings area symbol of **independence**, and Antoinette did not have any, so she thought that she was better off dead\n        *   Through suicide she gains freedom and betrays Rochester\n2. Red dress\n    *   The red dress triggers many memories (that were left out earlier in the narration) for Antoinette\n        *   For example, her and Sandi’s relation: he also asked her if she wanted to elope and they often kissed\n        *   She does not share this with Grace Poole, reinforcing her distrust of her\n    *   Her red dress comes in stark contrast to the white dress of the white girl she saw (Jane Eyre)\n        *   The dress symbolizes passion\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n1. Similarities between Rochester and Antoinette\n    *   Both are delusional and both were neglected at childhood and then forced to marry; both like rum – it allowed them to escape reality\n    *   They were alcoholics as they did not have work at the plantation because no more slaves, so the only thing to do was drink. This created a state of disarray as the transition from slaves to no slaves was very abrupt\n2. Marriage\n    *   There is some hypocrisy: Rochester received money as a dowry in marrying Antoinette, while Amelie paid Rochester money to have sex with him\n    *   The first one is socially acceptable and the other one is socially unacceptable\n3. Names\n    *   After starting at the tapestry hanging on her wall for a long time, she starts seeing her mother, but doesn't tell Grace about it – she is hallucinating and slowly losing her sanity\n        *   She feels disconnected from her identity\n    *   She also notes that “Grace” does not fit Grace Poole, and seems to have a distrust of her\n4. Antoinette’s death; shouting Tia\n    *   When she jumps into the fire, she decides to shout Tia’s name\n\n\n# More notes\n\n\n## Slavery\n\n\n\n*   In Wide Sargasso Sea, the Emancipation act led to the freedom of the slaves\n*   But slavery also exists between husband and wife, as seen by Antoinette and her husband: this is a different type of slavery\n*   Slavery also extends to post-colonial slavery\n    *   Antoinette’s husband tells Christophe that he will turn her for her Obeah practices\n    *   This suppression continues even after the Emancipation act\n\n\n## Burning of houses\n\n\n\n*   Two houses burned down in the novel\n*   The burning of the houses is a symbolism and parallelism\n    *   First the slaves burned the house to avenge themselves\n    *   It is implied that Antoinette, at the end of the novel, burns her husband’s house down to escape\n        *   She killed herself in the process, so she lays down her life in the hope to be free and destroy her husband\n        *   She shows her agency by doing this\n\n\n## Antoinette’s agency\n\n\n\n*   She tries to \n\n\n# Themes\n\n\n## Identity\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette does not fit in anywhere as she is a creole English\n    *   She is neither Jamaican nor from England, so she feels like an outsider, and others also treat her like one\n*   Chrisophone, on the other hand is portrayed as Caribbean, while Antoinette does not fit it anywhere\n\n\n## Slavery and freedom\n\n\n\n*   Conflict is created between the newly emancipated slaves and their owners\n    *   Their interactions lead to the bringdown of the Coulibri\n\n\n## Power\n\n\n\n*   Chrisotophone has access to Obeah\n*   Rochester has the power to change Antoinette’s name\n\n\n## Money\n\n\n## Women and power\n\n\n\n*   The female characters in Wide Sargasso Sea were confronted by societal forces that prevent them from acting and sustaining themselves\n*   The only socially acceptable ways for a woman to attain security were marriage and entering the convert \n*   In Annette’s case, the marriage destroyed not only hers, but also her children’s lives\n    *   Alexander Cosway, the first husband had many affairs publicly, and therefore many bastard children\n    *   When he died, he left the family destitute\n    *   He ignored her pleas to move out, which ended up killing Pierre and causing her to descend to madness\n    *   Antoinette was forced to marry Rochester by Mr Mason for money: this marriage was only done for financial benefit to Rochester and Mr Mason; he essentially sold her\n*   Rochester sleeps with Amelie, without making any effort to hide it from Antoinette, while still on their honeymoon\n*   The female characters who embody strength and agency are those who decide to remain outside the control of men/husbands\n    *   One example is Christophone\n        *   Christophine was respected in her community for her expertise in Obeah, and Antoinette also depended on her\n        *   She states that “Women must have spunks to live in this wicked world”, and ““All women, all colours, nothing but fools. Three children I have. One living in this world, each one a different father, but no husband, I thank my God. I keep my money. I don’t give it to no worthless man”\n    *   Auto Cora is a widow who does not remarry\n        *   She was relatively stable, and able to control her health and movements\n        *   She also promises safety for Antoinette \n*   Amelie is a minor character who also demonstrates that power can be with those outside traditional marriages\n    *   She manipulates sex to exercise to gain control over her employers, so she sleeps with and receives money from Rochester\n    *   She also says that she plans to move to Rio to continue the same tactic: “She wanted to go to Rio. There were rich men in Rio”\n\n\n## Horror novel\n\n\n\n*   Wide Sargasso Sea explores ideas of domestic abuse and cruelty\n*   For example, rochester renames Antoinette\n    *   Antoinette first has a name, then it is taken from her. This shows how she lost her identity to the unnamed character\n    *   He renames her Bertha, just like a slave-owner renaming its possessions, in order to assert his dominance, and distance himesend from her heritage and alleged madness\n    *   He has also taken her money, property, sense of security, emotional happiness, secual dignity, and finally her name\n    *   He calls her laugh a “crazy laugh”, which justifies in his delusion, his abuse of her\n    *   He also pretends to believe that she has harmed him: “You deceived me, betrayed me”\n    *   He also reduced her to a “doll” and a “marionette”, a plaything and object to be manipulated\n    *   At the end, he describes her as if he is on the perpetrator of her destruction: “only a ghost … nothing left but hopelessness”\n    *   He also makes sure he can never get away from her: “She’s mad but mine … my lunatic. My mad girl”",html:"<ul>\n<li>Set in the 1830s, after the Emancipation Act</li>\n<li>Set in Jamaica</li>\n<li>Victorian</li>\n<li>Literature is response to society of the time

Wide Sargasso Sea felt that Bertha (Antoinette in Wide Sargasso Sea) was not portrayed in the best way possible</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The symbol of the <strong>fire</strong> is there in both books; it is a symbol of freedom\n<ul>\n<li>In Jane Eyre, Bertha commits suicide with fire</li>\n<li>The symbol fire connects the two books, but the differences in perspectives and the husband unnamed keeps the two books apart and makes Wide Sargasso Sea its own story by giving Antoinette and identity (which was destroyed by the end)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>SIgnificance of the title</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>sea</strong> is a symbol to <strong>isolation</strong> referring to Antoinette</li>\n<li>It is a sea which is in between many others, and from the outside, they all look the same, almost indistinguishable\n<ul>\n<li>However, Antoinette’s problems, although they might look common, are in fact very destructive</li>\n<li>Not many people understood her problems</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This is similar to Antoinette, most people think she has the same problems as everyone else, but her problems are more important: also, from the outside her problems really cannot be seen, only when we zoom in we can see them</li>\n<li>The sea is also covered in seaweed and is unusually calm in the Bermuda triangle\n<ul>\n<li>Covered in seaweed shows the concealment, how her feelings were quite literally locked up (because of neglect by her mother)</li>\n<li>Bermuda triangle is a place of conflict as it was believed to be a place of destruction</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The fact that it is “Wide” shows the big gap between the two ways of life of the colonizers and the creoles\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette is figuratively in between Jamaica

too wide open and different, and there is not actual union between them\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s husband is english while Antoinette is a woman whose identity is framed by her creole nature, and her ways are different from his, and so she was not accepted by locals</li>\n<li>So the “<strong>wide</strong>” sea also represents a physical and geographical separation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Narrators</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The novel follows a complicated narrative strategy with <strong>multiple perspectives</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If we only saw Antoinette’s perspective, we will see her as a <strong>biased</strong> and <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n<li>However, we see a more <strong>holistic view</strong> of her and how she has been affected through the different perspectives, which bring out the different facets of her character</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This comes in contrast to the single narrative in <em>Jane Eyre</em>; <em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em> is in <strong>response</strong> to that book\n<ul>\n<li><em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em> provides an explanation for why the madwoman exists in the first place</li>\n<li>In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, there is only one narrative account in her name, and although she was marginalized for being poor, she didn't suffer from the racial implications</li>\n<li>For her, the madwoman is just crazy, and she doesn’t go into details to why she is mad\n<ul>\n<li>To JE, the madwoman (Antoinette) is a villain in her happiness</li>\n<li>So JR provides multiple reasons why the “madwomen” even exists, and why she is locked up</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part 1: Antoinette</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In Jane Eyre, Bertha Mason’s story is told from the perspective of the narrator, Jane Eyre, who views her as the ‘madwomen’</li>\n<li>In this novel, she gets to voice her own experience</li>\n<li>In the story, we see her change from child to adolescent</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unreliable narrator</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The narration makes the readers feel “closer” to the storyteller as she expressed her inner thoughts, feelings, and also dreams however this makes us as the readers less critical and blind to her faults as it is easier to sympathize for her</li>\n<li>Her story is full of gaps and silence, and also secrets\n<ul>\n<li>There are certain parts of the story she chooses not to disclose</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stream of consciousness</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows the mingling of a child’s perspective to the older narrator's memories</li>\n<li>As she watches Pierre sleep, she reflects on Mr Mason’s plans, the future, and the bamboos</li>\n<li>All these descriptions come in sharp contrast to the events yet to come</li>\n<li>At the beginning, most of the events happen in order but later, it is left to the readers understand as if they are a part of the story</li>\n<li>Stream of consciousness also reflects on her uncertainties: this is seen through her lack of traditional sentence structures, and lack of formal dialogues\n<ul>\n<li>Her thoughts are <strong>disjointed</strong> as there are gaps in understanding and narration</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She is only recollecting various disconnected thoughts, and sharing her personal thoughts: this gives the reader a glimpse into her mind as she does not share everything</li>\n<li>There are many gaps in the narrative (makes her an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong>)\n<ul>\n<li>One gap was after the burning down of the Coulibri\n<ul>\n<li>The gap shows that she feels shocked and is in a state of bewilderment or fear</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There was a minor gap after Annett asks her whose dress she was wearing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part 2: Antoinette’s husband</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Her husband also receives his own point of view and in the story this allows for\n<ul>\n<li>Different points of view on his experienced and relathips offered to readers</li>\n<li>Readers to feel closer to his experience, and not only Antoinette’s</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Similar to Antoinette, he also has dislocated experienced of\n<ul>\n<li>New cultural experienced</li>\n<li>Intense sensual effects of the world</li>\n<li>Sexual passion</li>\n<li>Memory and relations with family</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>JR uses a range of narrative techniques for representing the confused responses to the world and people around him</li>\n<li>His first person narrative is manipulated to reveal is precarious sense of his own identity</li>\n<li>The setting is <strong>overwhelming</strong> to him, and he feels disconnected</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stream of consciousness</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>His stream of consciousness makes the novel <strong>less</strong> <strong>biased</strong>, and it introduces the idea of Antoinette’s voice being <strong>muted</strong>, which is further emphasized by the setting change (England, a place Antoinette doesn't feel comfortable in)</li>\n<li>There are often differences in what he things and what he says</li>\n<li>He has many cultural confusions</li>\n<li>He does not understand the colonizers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Daniel cosway</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>He provides many of the details Antoinette never told Rochester</li>\n<li>However, he does not mention the fire at the Coulibri that lead to Annette's grief and hence madness</li>\n<li>He is therefore an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part 3: Grace Poole and Antoinette</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The first italicized part is by Grace Poole, Antoinette’s jailer</li>\n<li>The second part is narrated by Antoinette, who is now the “madwoman in the attic”</li>\n<li>She employs <strong>stream of consciousness</strong> through inner monologue</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Other characters are also given their own stories, although not through first-person narratives</li>\n<li>We only hear their voice through dialogs, letters</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Annette</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We get Antoinette’s memories of her, her dialogs reported by Antoinette, gossip and comments of servants and other family members, and information given to Rochester by Daniel Cosway And Christophine</li>\n<li>Her descriptions can be contradictory as Antoinette is an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n<li>Antoinette doesn't describe her mother’s decline until she is forced to explain her family history to Rochester in Part 2\n<ul>\n<li>This also shows that they were never close (expanded below)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Aunt Cora and Mr Mason</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s memories, speech and dialog, gossip</li>\n<li>We also get conflicted opinions of them</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>White community</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s speech often slips into recounting local white gossip about her family</li>\n<li>This method of narration ensures that the voice remains hers, but also reveals the values and attitudes of the white community to which she belongs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Christophine</h3>\n<p>Her character is constructed from</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s first person narrative: her importance as an influence is demonstrated by the amount of attention she is given in Antoinette’s memories\n<ul>\n<li>Her appearance, manner, and personality are carefully described early in Part 1.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gossip and fragments of dialog retold by Antoinette reveal the attitudes of other people</li>\n<li>Rochester’s POV: he initially sees her as a servant, but he ends up treating her with hostility once he suspects her of using obeah practices on him\n<ul>\n<li>Although the part is narrated by Rochester, she is given her own voice by inserting sections of dialog, in which she confronts Rochester in a very dramatic way.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Letter from Mr Frazer to Rochester: we see an opinion on her held by the judicial element within the white community</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Daniel Cosway</h3>\n<p>He is represented within Rochester's first person narration</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Letters; he sends two letters to Rochester in which he presents his perspective on Antoinette’s family background, which Fuels Rochester's suspensions about insanity</li>\n<li>Dialog: his speech is reported by Rochester\n<ul>\n<li>He can command in different styles of speech with rhetorical and biblical resonances</li>\n<li>He modulates into more natural styles of speech later</li>\n<li>However, his dialog is presented by Rochester, and is therefore colored by his perspective.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He is also an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Black servants and the blacks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mainly reported through speech and dialog in Antoinette’s narration</li>\n<li>The wider black community is notably silent in the novel</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Structure</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>There are two main narrators: <strong>Antoinette’s husband</strong> (unnamed) and <strong>Antoinette</strong>, creating a duality of antagonist and protagonist: this creates dichotomy as both are protagonists during the time they narrate the story</li>\n<li>This dichotomy creates a <strong>contrast</strong> in personality, themes, and cultures</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conflict of cultures and characters</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette is part of the West Indies culture while Rochester comes from a patriarchal, colonial power</li>\n<li>We see the differences in their ideologies: Antoinette likes nature and prefers to be in the garden while Rochester says: “I hated the mountains and the hills, the rivers and the rain. I hated the sunsets of whatever colour, I hated its beauty and it’s magic and the secret I would never know.” Whatever Antoinette describes evokes sympathy and emotion, while Rochester finds the sun and vibrant colors overwhelming: he does not understand interrelations of black and white</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contrast of themes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Need to finish</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why is the book divided into different parts?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To show the flow of time: from childhood, to adolescence, and then a sudden shift to marriage</li>\n<li>To show a shift in her mental status\n<ul>\n<li>To show that she tries to find security, but fails to do so\n<ul>\n<li>In Part 2, she tries to find security, but fails to do so</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sympathies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In Part 1, we are sympathetic to Antoinette</li>\n<li>In Part 2, we are still sympathetic towards her\n<ul>\n<li>But we get to know her story through her husband, so it is counter-intuitive that we do not sympathize for the narrator</li>\n<li>Although we see all his thoughts and motives, we don't sympathize for him</li>\n<li>Even after known that he a victim of parental influence and manipulation (forced marriage), we don't sympathize for him</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Part 1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Narrated by Antoinette; she describes her childhood</li>\n<li>There is little flow in the stories with many skips between events as she recollects; one event does not lead to another</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<h2>Characters</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Antoinette\n<ul>\n<li>Her childhood experiences have shaped her character: she receives no comfort or love from her mother, and is <strong>mocked in the society for her origins</strong>, something she cannot control\n<ul>\n<li>She is constantly compared to her mother too (in a bad way), which is, again, something which is out of reach: “Look the crazy girl, you like your mother … She have eyes like zombi and you have eyes like zombi too”</li>\n<li>This also foreshadows that she will end up like her mother</li>\n<li>It also shows that others don't see her as a human being because she is of a different race.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Her one true friend or solace she found ended up joining the society in mocking her after stealing from her\n<ul>\n<li>This, in a way, caused her to be determined to be away from people, as she was neglected, and Tia betrayed her</li>\n<li>We found out early on that her mother was not fond of her as she ignored her and seldom talked to her, so Antoinette gradually started to avoid people</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Similar to the Garden (symbol), she was <strong>left (neglected) to grow wild</strong>, with no care or guidance\n<ul>\n<li>She was rejected by her mother</li>\n<li>She also states that the company of the grasses was “better, better than people” – it is clear that she was <strong>neglected</strong> as a child</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After the remarriage, she finds her own home <strong>alienating</strong> as she has a new fear of Christophine and her practices of Obeah, although she grew up trusting her\n<ul>\n<li>This fear is based off of gossip she hears in the wedding, and she is struggling to determine what is true</li>\n<li>We feel sympathetic towards her as she feels unsafe in her own home</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After her dress is stolen by Tia, Christophine argues with Annette about how she doesn't have any more dresses: “She run wild, she grow up worthless.

this shows the disconnect between Antoinette and her mother</li>\n<li>Information about her that is unrevealed comes to readers through gossip, such as her death</li>\n<li>This shows that Antoinette thought that it wasn't important anymore as she neglected her so much during childhood – their disconnect is clear</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She foreshadows her daughter’s future as she goes insane as a result of what her husband did\n<ul>\n<li>The similarity between their names also foreshadows that they will have similar lives.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We later learn in Part 2 that she was sexualy abused by the caretakesr, but Antoinette was unable to mention it because of the trauma she was going through\n<ul>\n<li>She also refused to describe it in the hopes that it did not actually happen</li>\n<li>The caretakers were black, and shows a role reversal as usually the white slave owners would force sexual relationships with the black slaves before emancipation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Christophine\n<ul>\n<li>She is the one person who stands by Antoinette’s side, and she teaches her the importance of her Creole heritage and to be proud of it through her songs</li>\n<li>She herself expresses her heritage boldy through the way she dresses, but still tries to fit in by maintaining her accent</li>\n<li>She is feared by the locals as she practises obeah</li>\n<li>“She was your father's wedding present”: she was a freed slave, and she shows loyalty to Annette and her family and does not abandon them</li>\n<li>She is very close to Anette, she even says “Some people say/think [Annette] crazy” when Annette does not understand how poor they are\n<ul>\n<li>This also suggests the intimacy of their relationship</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After the coulibri is renovated, Antoinette has a new fear of her due to obeah\n<ul>\n<li>Because of this and the new servants combined with her neglecting mother, she finds her new home very alienating.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tia\n<ul>\n<li>She is the representative of the society to Antoinette</li>\n<li>Before making friends with Antoinette, she insulted her</li>\n<li>When Antoinette decides to go live with her, Tia throws a rock at her forehead, showing that she was never accepted by her</li>\n<li>She bettered Antoinette in greed for money and through of her as a “white nigger”;

For example, at Coulibri, the local population of black former slaves are deeply angry. Antoinette also says “They hated us”. She was also called a “white cockroach, go away, go away. Nobody want you”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ignorance and money, the reason Mr Mason did not want to leave</li>\n<li>Women and power\n<ul>\n<li>Annette wanted to leave the Coulibri, but was unable to as she couldn't convince Mr Mason\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to how the bird’s wings were clipped, she has a lack of independence in the marriage: the bird’s wings are a metaphor for her independence which is being diminished by Mr Mason</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The garden\n<ul>\n<li>The garden at the Coulibri is a symbol of life, or eventually Antoinette as it too runs wild because it is uncared for</li>\n<li>Antoinette finds comfort in the moss of the garden and enjoys wondering about the unexplored areas\n<ul>\n<li>She was <strong>forced</strong> to find comfort in the garden because she was <strong>neglected</strong> by annette, her mother.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Although she finds beauty in the overgrown orchids, she is afraid to go near them</li>\n<li>Different parts of the garden may present her qualities and her desires</li>\n<li>Antoinette described the garden with many bright colors: “green, white, purple”; she loves these colors and mentions them many times, while Rochester dislikes them and prefers brown and white instead</li>\n<li>“Snakey” looking is a biblical allusion to the snake, which is likely overgrown?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fire\n<ul>\n<li>In the novel, fire represents <strong>freedom and rebellion</strong> (Part 1, page 21, 22, and the end of Part 3)</li>\n<li>The ex-slaves set fire to the Coulibri as an act of <strong>defiance</strong> after being free following the Emancipation Act</li>\n<li>“So black and white, they burn the same, eh? (23)”: this, in a way, unites the whites and the blacks</li>\n<li>Furthermore, at the end of the play, it is suggested that Antoinette committed suicide with fire. In Jane Eyre, Antoinette (Bertha) commits suicide with fire, hence it symbolizes her <strong>rebellion</strong> in order to escape her husband</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hair\n<ul>\n<li>It is a symbol of the female characters’ agency and identity</li>\n<li>At the time of the fire, Annette’s mother had disheveled hair, showing that she is not taken seriously and that her identity doesn't mean anything to Mr Mason</li>\n<li>The fact that Antoinette’s hair has been cut without her knowledge foreshadows that she will slowly lose her identity and agency (This is true because her husband gives her a new name, Bertha, hence she loses her identity, and she also loses her freedom and has to follow her husband's orders)\n<ul>\n<li>Her identity is also being lost as she has lost her father and brother, and her mother is soon to die.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Eventually, Rochester calls her Bertha, which is not her real name\n<ul>\n<li>This is shows that she has lost her identity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Clothes\n<ul>\n<li>Symbolizes wealth, but only temporary in Part 1</li>\n<li>Clothes and money are divided: as Tia steals the dress</li>\n<li>Link to ADH: the <strong>tarantella dress</strong> is symbol/motif and is linked to <strong>objectification</strong> of women</li>\n<li>However, the removal of dresses in ADH heads to empowerment for the women while it is (bad for Antoinette)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Beginning racism\n<ul>\n<li>It is a powerful opening beginning with racism: “the Jamaican ladies had never approved of my mother” – the beginning shows that they were excluded socially\n<ul>\n<li>Many people had criticized her mother for being a widow</li>\n<li>This shows that in order for women to be successful, they had to have a man as they had a <strong>lack of agency</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The fallout between Tia and Antoinette was because of a racial tension, and it also foreshadows the relation with her husband</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Women and agency\n<ul>\n<li>Women with a husband/partner have a lack of agency when compared to those who decided not to marry</li>\n<li>This is evident in the case of Annette: she married twice and has a lack of agency and ends up being locked up</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Antoinette’s many dreams (pages 11 and 34)\n<ul>\n<li>Dreams are prevalent in Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea, in which they give us views of expressed and <strong>unexpressed emotions</strong>, and they <strong>foreshadow</strong> certain events</li>\n<li>Dreams in Wide Sargasso Sea contain <strong>parallel imagery</strong> to the dreams of Jane Eyre; the dreams on Antoinette are <strong>clairvoyant</strong> like Jane’s dreams, which reflect on a part of her consciousness</li>\n<li>In the novel, Antoinette has three dreams which are essentially of the same event, and they give us insight onto Antoinette’s maturing character and provide foreshadow</li>\n<li>The first dream is in her childhood when Tia steals her pennies and dress: “I dreamed that I was walking in the forest. Not alone. Someone who hated me was with me, out of sight. I could hear heavy footsteps coming closer and though I struggled and screamed, I could not move. I woke crying.”\n<ul>\n<li>This reflects on the young Antoinette's <strong>undeveloped sense of self-awareness</strong></li>\n<li>The fact that it is in the <strong>past tense</strong> suggests that Antoinette is distances from her dream consciousness, and the vagueness of the threat in her dream suggests that she herself does not understand her fears</li>\n<li>“Safe from the strangers”\n<ul>\n<li>Unknown what she is scared of</li>\n<li>Does not understand her fears</li>\n<li>Rudimentary dream which develops later</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Both Antoinette’s and Jane’s dreams are recurring: Antoinette had her “bad dream” again at the age of seventeen when Mr Mason tells her that he is arranging for suitors to visit her</li>\n<li>“Again I have left the house at Coulibri. It is still night and I am walking towards the forest. I am wearing a long dress and thin slippers, so I walk with difficulty, following the man who is with me and holding up the skirt of my dress. It is white and beautiful and I don't wish to get it soiled. I follow him, sick with fear but I make no effort to save myself; if anyone were to try to save me, I would refuse. This must happen. Now we have reached the forest. We are under the tall dark trees and there is no wind. &quot;Here?&quot; He turns and looks at me, his face black with hatred, and when I see this I begin to cry. He smiles slyly. &quot;Not here, not yet,&quot; he says, and I follow him, weeping. Now I do not try to hold up my dress, it trails in the dirt, my beautiful dress. We are no longer in the forest but in an enclosed garden surrounded by a stone wall and the trees are different trees. I do not know them. There are steps leading upwards. It is too dark to see the wall or the steps, but I know they are there and I think, &quot;It will be when I go up these steps. At the top.&quot; I stumble over my dress and cannot get up. I touch a tree and my arms hold on to it. 'Here, here.' But I think I will not go any further. The tree sways and jerks as if it is trying to throw me off. Still I cling and the seconds pass and each one is a thousand years. &quot;Here, in here,&quot; a strange voice said, and the tree stopped swaying and jerking. [34]”\n<ul>\n<li>Stream of consciousness</li>\n<li>Unlike the first dream, this second one occurs in the present tense, suggesting that the problems are more [present], and that she has grown closer to her dream consciousness</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the plot of the second dream is more <strong>clear</strong>, suggesting greater <strong>intelligence and perception</strong>, whereas the first one is <strong>vague</strong> with terms such as: “walking in the forest” with “someone who hated me”\n<ul>\n<li>She understands that there is a “man” who is “black with hatred”</li>\n<li>This could show how she is maturing and hence understands her problems much better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The fact that she attempts to keep the dress unsoiled demonstrates her concern with maintaining sexual purity\n<ul>\n<li>It also shows that she is submissive towards him, which she is (in the future)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This dream foreshadows the problems she will soon face with Rochester: the pure dress represents a wedding dress and the man with “hatred” represents Rochester, and her reluctance to join him symbolizes her reluctance to join Rochester</li>\n<li>Later in the book, she blindly listens to Rochester and performs sexual intimacy (she “masochistically and insistently lays herself on [the] sexual altar” and complies to all his orders) and “[makes] no effort to save [herself]”</li>\n<li>“Smile slyly”: Rochester, stays with her just to maintain property and money, shows how detrimental marriage is to her</li>\n<li>She trips on dress and unable to get up = marriage (wedding trap) traps her and is detrimental to her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Antoinette's safety\n<ul>\n<li>She never finds safety: her house on fire, unsafe marriage, improvement in England non-existent</li>\n<li>She was unsafe because she was unloved as a daughter (because of her gender)</li>\n<li>Discrimination also haunts her</li>\n<li>Women could only gain security through marriage or the convent school\n<ul>\n<li>The convent was quite patriarchal, and Antoinette struggled to adjust there</li>\n<li>She struggled to fit as the convert was based off of religion, which is opposed to black magic, which she grew up with Christophine</li>\n<li>Therefore, the convent creates an identity crisis</li>\n<li>Antoinette learns that women must be with men at the convent school, and she is trained to be a good wife: this relates to the theme of <strong>women and freedom</strong> as women had to live their life being in control of men, by learning how to please them</li>\n<li>Antoinette knows that marriage means a loss in freedom as she will be controlled by her husband\n<ul>\n<li>She decides not to talk to anyone about this in the hope that it is not true</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Quotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Garden better, better than people: Antoinette\n<ul>\n<li>She says this after Tia Leaves her</li>\n<li>Link to

the wedding wreaths: this foreshadows that he will treat the marriage carelessly</li>\n<li>When he and her try to connect, the differences are made more clear and his only way to understand her is to

cold as ice in the hot sun (47)”), suggesting that he feels no love of feelings/emotions for her at all</li>\n<li>One reason why he is <strong>disoriented</strong> and dislikes Antoinette with passion is because for him, she is emblematic of the Jamaican landscape, which he doesn't not enjoy as he dislikes the landscape and nature, as opposed to Antoinette, who finds comfort in nature.</li>\n<li>After seeing the letter (28), he gets lost in the forest, this can be related to Antoinette's dream\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike Antoinette, he is not well-versed with nature so he gets lost easily</li>\n<li>He also has less of an appeal to other people, so the girl was scared of him, and this is reinforced as he did not even realize/recognize Baptise looking for him, although it could

of destruction\n*   The fact that it is “Wide” shows the big gap between the two ways of life of the colonizers and the creoles\n    *   Antoinette is figuratively in between Jamaica and England\n    *   She is neither colonial nor Jamaican, she is a white creole\n*   Although Antonette marries a colonizer, there is a difference in perspectives, priorities are too wide open and different, and there is not actual union between them\n    *   Antoinette’s husband is english while Antoinette is a woman whose identity is framed by her creole nature, and her ways are different from his, and so she was not accepted by locals\n    *   So the “**wide**” sea also represents a physical and geographical separation\n\n\n# Narrators\n\n\n\n*   The novel follows a complicated narrative strategy with **multiple perspectives**\n    *   If we only saw Antoinette’s perspective, we will see her as a **biased** and **unreliable narrator**\n    *   However, we see a more **holistic view** of her and how she has been affected through the different perspectives, which bring out the different facets of her character\n*   This comes in contrast to the single narrative in _Jane Eyre_; _Wide Sargasso Sea_ is in **response** to that book\n    *   _Wide Sargasso Sea_ provides an explanation for why the madwoman exists in the first place\n    *   In _Jane Eyre_, there is only one narrative account in her name, and although she was marginalized for being poor, she didn't suffer from the racial implications\n    *   For her, the madwoman is just crazy, and she doesn’t go into details to why she is mad\n        *   To JE, the madwoman (Antoinette) is a villain in her happiness\n        *   So JR provides multiple reasons why the “madwomen” even exists, and why she is locked up\n\n\n## Part 1: Antoinette\n\n\n\n*   In Jane Eyre, Bertha Mason’s story is told from the perspective of the narrator, Jane Eyre, who views her as the ‘madwomen’\n*   In this novel, she gets to voice her own experience\n*   In the story, we see her change from child to adolescent\n\n\n### Unreliable narrator \n\n\n\n*   The narration makes the readers feel “closer” to the storyteller as she expressed her inner thoughts, feelings, and also dreams however this makes us as the readers less critical and blind to her faults as it is easier to sympathize for her\n*   Her story is full of gaps and silence, and also secrets\n    *   There are certain parts of the story she chooses not to disclose\n\n\n### Stream of consciousness\n\n\n\n*   Allows the mingling of a child’s perspective to the older narrator's memories\n*   As she watches Pierre sleep, she reflects on Mr Mason’s plans, the future, and the bamboos\n*   All these descriptions come in sharp contrast to the events yet to come\n*   At the beginning, most of the events happen in order but later, it is left to the readers understand as if they are a part of the story\n*   Stream of consciousness also reflects on her uncertainties: this is seen through her lack of traditional sentence structures, and lack of formal dialogues\n    *   Her thoughts are **disjointed** as there are gaps in understanding and narration\n*   She is only recollecting various disconnected thoughts, and sharing her personal thoughts: this gives the reader a glimpse into her mind as she does not share everything\n*   There are many gaps in the narrative (makes her an **unreliable narrator**)\n    *   One gap was after the burning down of the Coulibri\n        *   The gap shows that she feels shocked and is in a state of bewilderment or fear\n    *   There was a minor gap after Annett asks her whose dress she was wearing\n\n\n## Part 2: Antoinette’s husband\n\n\n\n*   Her husband also receives his own point of view and in the story this allows for\n    *   Different points of view on his experienced and relathips offered to readers\n    *   Readers to feel closer to his experience, and not only Antoinette’s\n*   Similar to Antoinette, he also has dislocated experienced of\n    *   New cultural experienced\n    *   Intense sensual effects of the world\n    *   Sexual passion\n    *   Memory and relations with family\n*   JR uses a range of narrative techniques for representing the confused responses to the world and people around him\n*   His first person narrative is manipulated to reveal is precarious sense of his own identity\n*   The setting is **overwhelming** to him, and he feels disconnected\n\n\n### Stream of consciousness\n\n\n\n*   His stream of consciousness makes the novel **less** **biased**, and it introduces the idea of Antoinette’s voice being **muted**, which is further emphasized by the setting change (England, a place Antoinette doesn't feel comfortable in)\n*   There are often differences in what he things and what he says\n*   He has many cultural confusions\n*   He does not understand the colonizers\n\n\n### Daniel cosway\n\n\n\n*   He provides many of the details Antoinette never told Rochester\n*   However, he does not mention the fire at the Coulibri that lead to Annette's grief and hence madness\n*   He is therefore an **unreliable narrator** \n\n\n## Part 3: Grace Poole and Antoinette\n\n\n\n*   The first italicized part is by Grace Poole, Antoinette’s jailer\n*   The second part is narrated by Antoinette, who is now the “madwoman in the attic”\n*   She employs **stream of consciousness** through inner monologue\n\n\n### Other\n\n\n\n*   Other characters are also given their own stories, although not through first-person narratives\n*   We only hear their voice through dialogs, letters\n\n\n### Annette\n\n\n\n*   We get Antoinette’s memories of her, her dialogs reported by Antoinette, gossip and comments of servants and other family members, and information given to Rochester by Daniel Cosway And Christophine\n*   Her descriptions can be contradictory as Antoinette is an **unreliable narrator**\n*   Antoinette doesn't describe her mother’s decline until she is forced to explain her family history to Rochester in Part 2\n    *   This also shows that they were never close (expanded below)\n\n\n### Aunt Cora and Mr Mason\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette’s memories, speech and dialog, gossip\n*   We also get conflicted opinions of them\n\n\n### White community\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette’s speech often slips into recounting local white gossip about her family\n*   This method of narration ensures that the voice remains hers, but also reveals the values and attitudes of the white community to which she belongs\n\n\n### Christophine\n\nHer character is constructed from\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette’s first person narrative: her importance as an influence is demonstrated by the amount of attention she is given in Antoinette’s memories\n    *   Her appearance, manner, and personality are carefully described early in Part 1.\n*   Gossip and fragments of dialog retold by Antoinette reveal the attitudes of other people\n*   Rochester’s POV: he initially sees her as a servant, but he ends up treating her with hostility once he suspects her of using obeah practices on him\n    *   Although the part is narrated by Rochester, she is given her own voice by inserting sections of dialog, in which she confronts Rochester in a very dramatic way.\n*   Letter from Mr Frazer to Rochester: we see an opinion on her held by the judicial element within the white community\n\n\n### Daniel Cosway\n\nHe is represented within Rochester's first person narration\n\n\n\n*   Letters; he sends two letters to Rochester in which he presents his perspective on Antoinette’s family background, which Fuels Rochester's suspensions about insanity\n*   Dialog: his speech is reported by Rochester\n    *   He can command in different styles of speech with rhetorical and biblical resonances\n    *   He modulates into more natural styles of speech later\n    *   However, his dialog is presented by Rochester, and is therefore colored by his perspective.\n*   He is also an **unreliable narrator**\n\n\n### Black servants and the blacks\n\n\n\n*   Mainly reported through speech and dialog in Antoinette’s narration\n*   The wider black community is notably silent in the novel\n\n\n# Structure\n\n\n\n*   There are two main narrators: **Antoinette’s husband** (unnamed) and **Antoinette**, creating a duality of antagonist and protagonist: this creates dichotomy as both are protagonists during the time they narrate the story\n*   This dichotomy creates a **contrast** in personality, themes, and cultures\n\n\n## Conflict of cultures and characters\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette is part of the West Indies culture while Rochester comes from a patriarchal, colonial power\n*   We see the differences in their ideologies: Antoinette likes nature and prefers to be in the garden while Rochester says: “I hated the mountains and the hills, the rivers and the rain. I hated the sunsets of whatever colour, I hated its beauty and it’s magic and the secret I would never know.” Whatever Antoinette describes evokes sympathy and emotion, while Rochester finds the sun and vibrant colors overwhelming: he does not understand interrelations of black and white\n\n\n## Contrast of themes\n\n\n\n*   Need to finish\n\n\n## Why is the book divided into different parts?\n\n\n\n*   To show the flow of time: from childhood, to adolescence, and then a sudden shift to marriage\n*   To show a shift in her mental status\n    *   To show that she tries to find security, but fails to do so\n        *   In Part 2, she tries to find security, but fails to do so\n\n\n### Sympathies\n\n\n\n*   In Part 1, we are sympathetic to Antoinette\n*   In Part 2, we are still sympathetic towards her\n    *   But we get to know her story through her husband, so it is counter-intuitive that we do not sympathize for the narrator\n    *   Although we see all his thoughts and motives, we don't sympathize for him\n    *   Even after known that he a victim of parental influence and manipulation (forced marriage), we don't sympathize for him\n\n\n# Part 1\n\n\n\n*   Narrated by Antoinette; she describes her childhood\n*   There is little flow in the stories with many skips between events as she recollects; one event does not lead to another\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n## Characters\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette\n    *   Her childhood experiences have shaped her character: she receives no comfort or love from her mother, and is **mocked in the society for her origins**, something she cannot control\n        *   She is constantly compared to her mother too (in a bad way), which is, again, something which is out of reach: “Look the crazy girl, you like your mother … She have eyes like zombi and you have eyes like zombi too”\n        *   This also foreshadows that she will end up like her mother\n        *   It also shows that others don't see her as a human being because she is of a different race.\n    *   Her one true friend or solace she found ended up joining the society in mocking her after stealing from her\n        *   This, in a way, caused her to be determined to be away from people, as she was neglected, and Tia betrayed her\n        *   We found out early on that her mother was not fond of her as she ignored her and seldom talked to her, so Antoinette gradually started to avoid people\n    *   Similar to the Garden (symbol), she was **left (neglected) to grow wild**, with no care or guidance\n        *   She was rejected by her mother\n        *   She also states that the company of the grasses was “better, better than people” – it is clear that she was **neglected** as a child\n    *   After the remarriage, she finds her own home **alienating** as she has a new fear of Christophine and her practices of Obeah, although she grew up trusting her\n        *   This fear is based off of gossip she hears in the wedding, and she is struggling to determine what is true\n        *   We feel sympathetic towards her as she feels unsafe in her own home\n    *   After her dress is stolen by Tia, Christophine argues with Annette about how she doesn't have any more dresses: “She run wild, she grow up worthless. And nobody care”\n    *   She is highly emotional and easily feels afraid and hatred, but learns to conceal it after numerous traumatic incidents in her life\n        *   She was forced to conceal her fears and emotions as she was neglected\n    *   She often decides not to talk about certain ideas: she decides not to verbalize certain things in the hope that they are not true\n        *   When the horse died, and when they became “marooned”, she did not tell anyone in the hope that it was not true\n        *   Also, when Mr Mason mentions a suitor, she gets a feeling of insecurity as she will lose her freedom, but she decides to ignore it in the hope that ignoring it will make it disappear\n            *   she understands the **suffocating** truths of marriage, as she has seen them in her mother\n2. Annette\n    *   Antoinette spends most of her early narration describing her mother, and see her progression from a beautiful Creole women who is ostracized by the society to a quite “thin” women who has lost any hope to live\n    *   She finally descends to madness after the fire, and learning that Pierre is dead; she loses all hopes and fears and to her death is the best way out\n        *   She has become disconnected from herself and her emotions as she has lost everything: her husband, her status (after the Emancipation act), and her son, so she chooses her ignore her family and try to escape it. \n    *   We see her signs of instability when she “speaks aloud to herself”, although the arrival of the Luttrell's gives her a new hope\n    *   She is never able to reconnect with Antoinette and wants to leave the past behind\n    *   The fact that her death/funeral is not described in detail shows the distance between Antoinette and Annette\n        *   We actually only understands what happens to the mother when she described it to Rochester; this shows the disconnect between Antoinette and her mother\n        *   Information about her that is unrevealed comes to readers through gossip, such as her death\n        *   This shows that Antoinette thought that it wasn't important anymore as she neglected her so much during childhood – their disconnect is clear\n    *   She foreshadows her daughter’s future as she goes insane as a result of what her husband did\n        *   The similarity between their names also foreshadows that they will have similar lives.\n    *   We later learn in Part 2 that she was sexualy abused by the caretakesr, but Antoinette was unable to mention it because of the trauma she was going through\t\n        *   She also refused to describe it in the hopes that it did not actually happen\n        *   The caretakers were black, and shows a role reversal as usually the white slave owners would force sexual relationships with the black slaves before emancipation\n3. Christophine\n    *   She is the one person who stands by Antoinette’s side, and she teaches her the importance of her Creole heritage and to be proud of it through her songs\n    *   She herself expresses her heritage boldy through the way she dresses, but still tries to fit in by maintaining her accent\n    *   She is feared by the locals as she practises obeah\n    *   “She was your father's wedding present”: she was a freed slave, and she shows loyalty to Annette and her family and does not abandon them\n    *   She is very close to Anette, she even says “Some people say/think [Annette] crazy” when Annette does not understand how poor they are\n        *   This also suggests the intimacy of their relationship\n    *   After the coulibri is renovated, Antoinette has a new fear of her due to obeah\n        *   Because of this and the new servants combined with her neglecting mother, she finds her new home very alienating.\n4. Tia\n    *   She is the representative of the society to Antoinette\n    *   Before making friends with Antoinette, she insulted her\n    *   When Antoinette decides to go live with her, Tia throws a rock at her forehead, showing that she was never accepted by her\n    *   She bettered Antoinette in greed for money and through of her as a “white nigger”; she also taunts Antoinette by saying “we ate salt fish”\n        *   She means to say that because Antoinette is so poor, she cannot afford fresh fish\n    *   She could be one of the driving forces in Antoinette’s life because she constantly mentions her name (in dreams and later in the book)\n    *   She stole Antoinette's clothes and hence her identity\n    *   Although they got along, money drew them apart again\n        *   The childish bet and disagreement reflects the socio-economic disparity between the whites and the blacks\n        *   The fact the Tia steals Antoinette’s dress and her money highlights the symbolic significance of appearance and attire in female power and security in the novel.\n5. Mr Mason\n    *   He is a representative of the white slave owners, a wealthy plantation owner\n    *   He portrays the theme of ignorance as he does not take Annette seriously about moving out; he is self-centered as he wants to make more money\n        *   He does not see Annette’s point of view because he does not understand racial relations on the island (similar to Rochester)\n    *   He is a new breed of the white men as he is cunning and bends laws to fit them to his liking: although the Emancipation Act ended the reign of slave owners, neo-colonialism takes place\n    *   Although Annette has no money, he still married her because he found her beautiful, but when he discovers that she is mentally ill, he locks her up in inhuman conditions\n        *   The fact that Annette and Antoinette are similar foreshadows that even Antoinette will end up in similar conditions\n        *   Sending Antoinette to be married can be similar to being locked up as she is sent against her will as she did not get a choice\n        *   In the end, she ended up getting locked up too: both their lives ended in similar ways\n    *   He has a dislike towards Aunt Cora as she did not help their family during the time of need (find page)\n        *   Furthermore, she was a successful woman, and saying that he dislikes her makes him superior as he is a man and hence he holds more power.\n    *   He misunderstands the locals and does not understand how dangerous they can be: “They're too damn lazy to be dangerous”, “They are children––they wouldn't hurt a fly”, “handful of drunken negroes”\n6. Pierre\n    *   He “staggered when he walked and couldn't speak distinctly”; he is mentally disabled \n    *   He is later described as an idiot to Rochester by Daniel Cosway the bastard\n        *   Rochester thought that the disease was genetic when it was not, so he thought Antoinette was also crazy like him\n        *   This can be linked to ADH: Dr. Rank’s diseases\n    *   Annette “changed” after hearing the doctor about Pierre’s conditions, suggesting that it was an incurable disease, that was likely a burden for the family\n7. Mr Luttrell\n    *   Kills his dog and goes to the sea never to come back\n        *   He has no money\n        *   After the Emancipation Act, he had nothing\n        *   He is a white male who was lost\n    *   He was in a state of despair following the Emancipation Act\n    *   His death sets the mood for the rest of the events, the mood of **despair and disillusionment**\n    *   His death gives Antoinette the troubled ideas of freedom\n8. Sandi Cosway\n    *   She is Antoinette’s black cousin: “I knew who he was, his name was Sandi, Alexander Cosway’s son. Once I would have said ‘my cousin Sandi’ but Mr Mason’s lectures had made me shy about my coloured relatives”\n    *   Mr Mason and his Superior Englishman attitude influenced Antoinette with Sandi Cosway\n        *   Antoinette understood that Mr Mason would not accept any friendship/relationship between her and Sandi\n        *   Mr Mason disliked Antoinette’s creole family (including Aunt Cora)\n        *   Mr Mason is also representative of the English society and their mindset, so the difference in skin color is a barrier that keeps the two apart: this social barrier is heavily linked to racial differences, which had heightened during this time period after the Emancipation Act\n\n\n## Themes\n\n\n\n1. Isolation and ostracizing based on races, and racial discrimination; alienation\n    *   Creoles are seen as being in between as they are not black or white, and are therefore not accepted in the society\n    *   Antoinette refers to non-creoles using the word “**they**” showing a disconnect and clear distinction between the two; this word is used quite early on in the novel suggestion animosity between blacks and whites in Jamaica\n    *   The fact that the family had to “[persuade] a Spanish Town doctor to visit” Pierre demonstrates the tension between the whites and blacks\n    *   The racial hierarchy in the 1830s in Jamaica was complex and strained with tensions between whites and creoles\n        *   There was resentment which lead to hatred and violence such as the Cosways being referred to as “**white cockroaches**”, and eventually being driven away from their homes from their former selves\n        *   These dynamics are also complicated by exclusion based on race, geographical origin, appearance, wealth, and status.\n    *   Major characters in the novel are defined by their inclusion or exclusion from cultural groups\n        *   Although Antoinette and the Cosways where white, they were not the dominant group of Jamaica as they were creoles.\n    *   Alienation leads to the characters of the novel being destructive too: Anette, driven by her family’s exclusions from white society, seeks marriage to Mr Mason, and this ultimately leads to the loss of her son and hence her sanity.\n    *   From the beginning, we see that Antoinette’s family is dysfunctional, and she is quite isolated because of this\n    *   The love marriage of Cosway was not happy as he had many bastard children with other women\n2. Internal isolation from family and neglect\n    *   This is one of the most prominent themes in the novel, and highly relates to Antoinette: she was constantly neglected from her mother, whose voice was neglected by Mr Mason\n    *   It was because of neglect that Annette was cast as an outsider, which leads to her mental breakdown\n3. Effect of the Emancipation Act on the society\n    *   The Emancipation Act of 1833 leaves discontent and violence as seen in Mr Luttrell, a white former slave owner, who commited suicide as he was unable to adjust to the new social and economic landscape.\n    *   Although the Emancipation Act freed slaves, slave owners suffered as shown by the Cosway family. For example, at Coulibri, the local population of black former slaves are deeply angry. Antoinette also says “They hated us”. She was also called a “white cockroach, go away, go away. Nobody want you”\n4. Ignorance and money, the reason Mr Mason did not want to leave\n5. Women and power\n    *   Annette wanted to leave the Coulibri, but was unable to as she couldn't convince Mr Mason\n        *   Similar to how the bird’s wings were clipped, she has a lack of independence in the marriage: the bird’s wings are a metaphor for her independence which is being diminished by Mr Mason\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n\n1. The garden\n    *   The garden at the Coulibri is a symbol of life, or eventually Antoinette as it too runs wild because it is uncared for\n    *   Antoinette finds comfort in the moss of the garden and enjoys wondering about the unexplored areas\n        *   She was **forced** to find comfort in the garden because she was **neglected** by annette, her mother.\n    *   Although she finds beauty in the overgrown orchids, she is afraid to go near them\n    *   Different parts of the garden may present her qualities and her desires\n    *   Antoinette described the garden with many bright colors: “green, white, purple”; she loves these colors and mentions them many times, while Rochester dislikes them and prefers brown and white instead\n    *   “Snakey” looking is a biblical allusion to the snake, which is likely overgrown?\n2. Fire\t\n    *   In the novel, fire represents **freedom and rebellion** (Part 1, page 21, 22, and the end of Part 3)\n    *   The ex-slaves set fire to the Coulibri as an act of **defiance** after being free following the Emancipation Act\n    *   “So black and white, they burn the same, eh? (23)”: this, in a way, unites the whites and the blacks\n    *   Furthermore, at the end of the play, it is suggested that Antoinette committed suicide with fire. In Jane Eyre, Antoinette (Bertha) commits suicide with fire, hence it symbolizes her **rebellion** in order to escape her husband\n3. Hair\n    *   It is a symbol of the female characters’ agency and identity\n    *   At the time of the fire, Annette’s mother had disheveled hair, showing that she is not taken seriously and that her identity doesn't mean anything to Mr Mason\n    *   The fact that Antoinette’s hair has been cut without her knowledge foreshadows that she will slowly lose her identity and agency (This is true because her husband gives her a new name, Bertha, hence she loses her identity, and she also loses her freedom and has to follow her husband's orders)\n        *   Her identity is also being lost as she has lost her father and brother, and her mother is soon to die. \n    *   Eventually, Rochester calls her Bertha, which is not her real name\n        *   This is shows that she has lost her identity\n4. Clothes\n    *   Symbolizes wealth, but only temporary in Part 1\n    *   Clothes and money are divided: as Tia steals the dress\n    *   Link to ADH: the **tarantella dress** is symbol/motif and is linked to **objectification** of women\n    *   However, the removal of dresses in ADH heads to empowerment for the women while it is (bad for Antoinette)\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n1. Beginning racism\n    *   It is a powerful opening beginning with racism: “the Jamaican ladies had never approved of my mother” – the beginning shows that they were excluded socially\n        *   Many people had criticized her mother for being a widow\n        *   This shows that in order for women to be successful, they had to have a man as they had a **lack of agency**\n    *   The fallout between Tia and Antoinette was because of a racial tension, and it also foreshadows the relation with her husband\n2. Women and agency\n    *   Women with a husband/partner have a lack of agency when compared to those who decided not to marry\n    *   This is evident in the case of Annette: she married twice and has a lack of agency and ends up being locked up\n3. Antoinette’s many dreams (pages 11 and 34)\n    *   Dreams are prevalent in Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea, in which they give us views of expressed and **unexpressed emotions**, and they **foreshadow** certain events\n    *   Dreams in Wide Sargasso Sea contain **parallel imagery** to the dreams of Jane Eyre; the dreams on Antoinette are **clairvoyant** like Jane’s dreams, which reflect on a part of her consciousness\n    *   In the novel, Antoinette has three dreams which are essentially of the same event, and they give us insight onto Antoinette’s maturing character and provide foreshadow\n    *   The first dream is in her childhood when Tia steals her pennies and dress: “I dreamed that I was walking in the forest. Not alone. Someone who hated me was with me, out of sight. I could hear heavy footsteps coming closer and though I struggled and screamed, I could not move. I woke crying.” \n        *   This reflects on the young Antoinette's **undeveloped sense of self-awareness**\n        *   The fact that it is in the **past tense** suggests that Antoinette is distances from her dream consciousness, and the vagueness of the threat in her dream suggests that she herself does not understand her fears\n        *   “Safe from the strangers”\n            *   Unknown what she is scared of\n            *   Does not understand her fears\n            *   Rudimentary dream which develops later\n    *   Both Antoinette’s and Jane’s dreams are recurring: Antoinette had her “bad dream” again at the age of seventeen when Mr Mason tells her that he is arranging for suitors to visit her\n    *   “Again I have left the house at Coulibri. It is still night and I am walking towards the forest. I am wearing a long dress and thin slippers, so I walk with difficulty, following the man who is with me and holding up the skirt of my dress. It is white and beautiful and I don't wish to get it soiled. I follow him, sick with fear but I make no effort to save myself; if anyone were to try to save me, I would refuse. This must happen. Now we have reached the forest. We are under the tall dark trees and there is no wind. \"Here?\" He turns and looks at me, his face black with hatred, and when I see this I begin to cry. He smiles slyly. \"Not here, not yet,\" he says, and I follow him, weeping. Now I do not try to hold up my dress, it trails in the dirt, my beautiful dress. We are no longer in the forest but in an enclosed garden surrounded by a stone wall and the trees are different trees. I do not know them. There are steps leading upwards. It is too dark to see the wall or the steps, but I know they are there and I think, \"It will be when I go up these steps. At the top.\" I stumble over my dress and cannot get up. I touch a tree and my arms hold on to it. 'Here, here.' But I think I will not go any further. The tree sways and jerks as if it is trying to throw me off. Still I cling and the seconds pass and each one is a thousand years. \"Here, in here,\" a strange voice said, and the tree stopped swaying and jerking. [34]”\n        *   Stream of consciousness\n        *   Unlike the first dream, this second one occurs in the present tense, suggesting that the problems are more [present], and that she has grown closer to her dream consciousness\n        *   Furthermore, the plot of the second dream is more **clear**, suggesting greater **intelligence and perception**, whereas the first one is **vague** with terms such as: “walking in the forest” with “someone who hated me”\n            *   She understands that there is a “man” who is “black with hatred”\n            *   This could show how she is maturing and hence understands her problems much better.\n        *   The fact that she attempts to keep the dress unsoiled demonstrates her concern with maintaining sexual purity\n            *   It also shows that she is submissive towards him, which she is (in the future)\n        *   This dream foreshadows the problems she will soon face with Rochester: the pure dress represents a wedding dress and the man with “hatred” represents Rochester, and her reluctance to join him symbolizes her reluctance to join Rochester\n        *   Later in the book, she blindly listens to Rochester and performs sexual intimacy (she “masochistically and insistently lays herself on [the] sexual altar” and complies to all his orders) and “[makes] no effort to save [herself]”\n        *   “Smile slyly”: Rochester, stays with her just to maintain property and money, shows how detrimental marriage is to her\n        *   She trips on dress and unable to get up = marriage (wedding trap) traps her and is detrimental to her\n4. Antoinette's safety\n    *   She never finds safety: her house on fire, unsafe marriage, improvement in England non-existent\n    *   She was unsafe because she was unloved as a daughter (because of her gender)\n    *   Discrimination also haunts her\n    *   Women could only gain security through marriage or the convent school\n        *   The convent was quite patriarchal, and Antoinette struggled to adjust there\n        *   She struggled to fit as the convert was based off of religion, which is opposed to black magic, which she grew up with Christophine\n        *   Therefore, the convent creates an identity crisis\n        *   Antoinette learns that women must be with men at the convent school, and she is trained to be a good wife: this relates to the theme of **women and freedom** as women had to live their life being in control of men, by learning how to please them\n        *   Antoinette knows that marriage means a loss in freedom as she will be controlled by her husband\n            *   She decides not to talk to anyone about this in the hope that it is not true\n\n\n## Quotes\n\n\n\n1.

Antoinette\n    *   She feels **isolation** because she cannot connect emotionally to her husband, and also because of **interracial differences** as she belongs to creoles of french\n    *   She is forced to turn to Christophone for protection when she’s scared\n        *   She asks him to make her husband love her using Obeah, but she is unable to (theme of **supernatural**)\n    *   At the end of this Part, she is referred to as a **[Doll](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.9x7rpt4yhono)**\n    *   No one knows why the town is called Massacre and its history, and this foreshadows the **fall of the marriage** and the **loss of identity** of Antoinette\n2. Her husband\n    *   This part is narrated from his **point of view**, and although he is inhuman, his actions are explained by his suffering, confusion and feelings of alienation\n    *   He is also distant from Antoinette and treats her like a stranger and analyzes her appearance critically (in a bad way)\n        *   He also misunderstands her local culture and considers her language inferior\n        *   His detachment from heirs cleaner, so he critically evaluates her without feeling any emotions for her\n    *   It is also implied that he is detached from her own family\n    *   He carelessly crushes the wedding wreaths: this foreshadows that he will treat the marriage carelessly\t\n    *   When he and her try to connect, the differences are made more clear and his only way to understand her is to compare her to an english girl: she ”might have been any pretty English girl”\n    *   Unlike Antoinette, he feels alienated and threatened by landscape and nature.\n    *   There is a clear difference between his and Antoinette’s structure in terms of emotional expression\n        *   He sees Baptiste looking mournful and finds the Caribbean way of displaying emotions as weak and vulnerable as compared to the English way of hiding and concealing emotions.\n    *   Of the wedding, he only remembers the marble and Antoinette’s **cold hands** (“It was cold as ice in the hot sun (47)”), suggesting that he feels no love of feelings/emotions for her at all\n    *   One reason why he is **disoriented** and dislikes Antoinette with passion is because for him, she is emblematic of the Jamaican landscape, which he doesn't not enjoy as he dislikes the landscape and nature, as opposed to Antoinette, who finds comfort in nature.\n    *   After seeing the letter (28), he gets lost in the forest, this can be related to Antoinette's dream\n        *   Unlike Antoinette, he is not well-versed with nature so he gets lost easily\n        *   He also has less of an appeal to other people, so the girl was scared of him, and this is reinforced as he did not even realize/recognize Baptise looking for him, although it could have been because he was quite disoriented\n        *   This comes in stark contrast to Antoinette’s dream at the end of Part 1\n    *   There is sexual tension between him and Amélie, which foreshadows their sexual relationship\n    *   He pities himself, although Antoinette is the bigger victim\n        *   He is able to self-pity as he holds more power in their relationship\n    *   We never see him working; he is living off the money he earned as a slave owner\n    *   He has limited power as compared to other english men as he was the second son\n        *   He had no choice; he was forced to listen to his father\n        *   But he still made his own (bad, incorrect) choices like cheating on Antoinette when he could have been a better husband, so readers do not sympathize for him (even though we see everything from his point of view)\n    *   He wants to care for Antoinette, but decides not to due to his bitter feelings\n        *   He also does not care for the boy who learned English in the hopes of staying with him\n        *   When the boy cries like that, he feels he is crying “for nothing”, reiterating the fact that he shows no remorse\n        *   After a struggle between compassion and bitterness, bitterness has taken over completely\n3. Daniel Cosway\n    *   He is another character similar to Antoinette who has led a life of inherited suffering\n        *   His is likely her half-brother, a result of Cosway and a slave\n    *   While Antoinette is culturally different from everyone else around her, Daniel is racially different as he has a black mother and white father\n    *   Daniel is a bastard son, similar to Antoinette who was rejected as a child by her mother\n    *   Both he and Antoinette share their sense of **isolation, displacement, and anger**\n    *   Letter of page 59: he is spiteful and attacks Antoinette and his and her family by stating how madness runs in the family\t\n        *   There were tensions between emancipated slaves and their owners.\n    *   He wants revenge on Antoinette and the Cosways as his existence was **marginalized**\n        *   He holds them responsible for his situation\n    *   No one is truly sure about his identity and origins\n        *   Even Amélie, who seems to know him is unsure about his real name\n        *   Everyone relies on gossip to know who is truly is\n4. Christophine\n    *   She believes that most women are foolish to rely only on their husbands, so she stays single so that she can stay independent, although she has had three children from different men\n    *   She also has her own money: “I keep my money. I don't give it to no worthless man”\n    *   When Christophine gives Antoinette her inheritance, the wealth now belongs to her husband\n        *   She and Antoinette loses money this way\n        *   She calls Mr Mason “worse than Satan” as he got Antoinette and forced her (sold her) into marrying Rochester\n    *   She is shown to not easily trust people; her distrust is clear\n        *   she does not believe that England exists: “I never see the damn place, how I know?”\n        *   This differentiates her from Antoinette, who relies on trust (she trusts her geography books)\n        *   Christophone treats that place she has never personally experienced with skepticism\n        *   She also does not even trust her own son (Jo-jo) to not leak out what Antoinette and her have been planning: she described him as “Nothing but leaky calabash that boy\"\n    *   She uses obeah to make Rochester love Antoinette again, but ends up fleeing as he knows that she has drugged him\n        *   This gets her in trouble with the law, so she has to leave Antoinette, and cannot help her anymore as she is powerless\n        *   It is Mr Fraser who informs the husband that she is a practitioner of Obeah and considers her dangerous as she has a criminal record\n5. Aunt Cora\n    *   She is shown to be defeated in comparison to Christophine as she “she turned her face to the wall”\n    *   She was unable to help Antoinette escape the control of Mr Mason and Richard Mason, who married her to Rochester to get money\n6. Amélie\n    *   A maid at Granbois who shows no respect for the husband and Antoinette, although she fears Christophone\n    *   She flirtatiously mocks Rochester until he sleeps with her\n    *   She has sex with the husband, and Antoinette is fully aware of it\n        *   Her husband decides to sleep with her just to mess with Antoinette and maker her weaker than she already is\n7. The Young Bull\n    *   His name illustrates his aggressive desire for dominance\n    *   He tries to impress Rochester by showing that he can speak English and demonstrating his knowledge\n\n\n## Themes\n\n\n\n1. Alienation\n    *   Daniel Cosway, a mixed-race illegitimate child of Cosway, wants to gain revenge for everyone marginalizing his existence\n        *   His exclusion from the Cosway family leads to him to write a series of letters to Rochester **maligning** Antoinette and the rest of her family\n    *   These **letters** disturb Rochester and are the **catalyst** for his ultimate distrust and distaste for Antoinette (Link to ADH as paper is [catalyst](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.jx83je1nb652))\n2. Obeah and colonial mindset\n    *   Everyone feared obeah for what it could do\n    *   Antoinette’s husband has a colonial viewpoint, so he distrusted Christophine for her Obeah practices\n    *   Through obeah, Antoinette tries to change her husband\n    *   When the husband knows that he has been manipulated by obeah, he decides to take away Antoinette's **identity** by naming her Bertha\n        *   He attacks her physcologically\n        *   This changing of her name also shows that he holds all the power in the relationship\n        *   It is ironic that an unnamed character is able to strip a named (main) character from her identity so easily; this shows how much power colonial men had (patriarchal society)\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n\n1. Typical white colonists of the time (see Antoinette’s husband remains unnamed in Part 2)\n    *   He is not named, and Rhys generalizes all white colonists to be similar to him\n        *   Rhys wants us to sympathize for Antoinette (even though her husband is the narrator), and she does this by not giving him a name\n    *   Being a colonist, he is a person who ‘extracts what he needs’: for this reason, he disliked nature\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette’s husband remains unnamed\n    *   This is done so that the writer can use his character to represent all typical white colonists – he is symbolic to all of them as he is a perfect example of one\n    *   This is furthered by the fact that he does not work and he only drinks; white colonists would have all the servants do work for them\n    *   Furthermore, the writer only wants to represent the point of view of Antoinette, so giving him a name and hence an identity is difficult and will go against the main point in the novel\n    *   It is deeply **ironic** that the **unnamed** character robbed the main characters of her name and her identity: although he is unnamed, he holds power as he is a man\n    *   He also wants to distance himself from her\n    *   Not giving him a name essentially generalizes him and all other white colonial men\n    *   On the other hand, women are individualized, as Antoinette is given a name and also given more emphasis to as this is a feminist novel\n    *   The story is also mainly through the feminine perspective, and his name is not mentioned so that Antoinette can occupy the center stage\n    *   The fact that he is unnamed also creates a **cold sense of unfamiliarity** which allows to relate with Antoinette as she is also in anew place\n2. The letter from Daniel Cosway\n    *   Antoinette’s husband says that he was expecting the letter, and this shows that he never truly loved her: “I felt no surprise. It was as if I’d expected it, been waiting for it (62)”\n    *   Daniel writes a letter to Rochester stating that he is an illegitimate child of Mr Cosway\n    *   Similar to A Doll’s House, paper is a catalyst\n\n\n# Part 3\n\n\n\n*   Narrated by Grace Poole, a character who gives a **less biased** view of the story\n*   There are shifting perspectives, which allows people to interpret their own view: multidimensional nature of the characters: “there is always another side (82)”\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n\n*   This part is in the POV of Grace Poole\n*   Antoinette is being kept in the attic of her husband’s house against her will with Grace Poole\n*   Later, the narration switches back to Antoinette’s consciousness and Grace Poole tells her that Richard Mason visited, and that Antoinette attacked him with a knife\n\n\n## Characters\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette’s husband (Rochester)\n    *   Rochester sleeps with Amelie as he feels alienated with Antoinnette\n    *   Christiphone uses Obeah to make Rochester desire Antoinette, but it only had little effect\n    *   hough he got sexually attracted to her, he still sleeps with Amelie as he **suspects** Antoinette – he is **vindictive** as he knows he’s been messed with, and he is also very **manipulative**\n    *   We learn that he has been manipulated by his father in marrying Antoinette, he did not have a choice in this decision\n        *   This makes the readers sympathize for him, but his later actions on Antoinette show that he is inhuman\n    *   He is quite critical of Antoinette’s beauty and objectifies her: he breaks down every component of her face and looks at her with hatred\n        *   He also says that her beauty is a “trick of the light”, showing that he only finds her beautiful at specific times of the day\n        *   He also feels that she is manipulative, as she used Obeah to make him love her\n2. Antoinette\n    *   She is going crazy, just like her mother, and her death is also foreshadowed by her husband: “I drew the sheet over her gently as if I covered a dead girl”; it also states that he marriage satisfaction is dead\n    *   She is unsure about how much time passes as she is going crazy after being alone\n    *   The fact that she doesn't remember attacking Richard Mason with a knife shows that she is losing consciousness\n        *   She cannot remember her violent actions and believes that she didn't recognize Richard Mason\n        *   She also said that she saw a girl in a white dress and thought it was a ghost; this is most likely Jane Eyre\n    *   The red dress reminds her of the relationship she had with Sandi Cosway\n    *   She drops the red dress\n        *   When it spreads like fire, she is one step closer to what she wishes to do\n        *   The color red symbolizes her passion\n    *   She steals Grace’s keys to explore the house\n    *   She has everything taken away from her\n        *   She cannot even please Rochester as she ever sees him again\n        *   She does not have a mirror to see how she herself looks \n    *   At the end, she has a dream about setting the house to fire, climbing on top, then jumping to her death\n        *   This reminds her of the fire in the Coulibri\n        *   When she wakes up, she decides to act out her dream, although it is unclear\n    *   Dreams: again, the dream foreshadows what will truly happened\n3. Grace Poole\n    *   She narrates the first part of Part 3\n        *   She seems to be an **unreliable narrator** as she gossips\n    *   She is paid twice as much as any other servant to keep quiet about the “madwoman in the attic”, although she is uncomfortable about Antoinette’s conditions\n        *   However, she often falls asleep, allowing Antoinette to take her keys and roam around the house\n    *   She was also in Jane Eyre\n    *   She says: “the world outside…can be a black and cruel world to a woman”; where **black** is a reference to one of Antoinette's dreams, where she was being chased by a man “black with hatred”\n    *   Unlike Christophine, she only takes care of her for money; she subdied her for money\n        *   Christophine, on the other hand was more concerned for Antoinette; she awsa s supporting mother figure for her\n\n\n## Themes\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n\n1. Fire\n    *   When Grace Poole lit a fire, Antoinette admires its beauty and wonders why she was locked in the attic\n        *   At this point, her narration is hazy and she only observes things that happen around her\n    *   Fire is both destructive and redemptive in the novel\n        *   In both cases, it was used to rebel too: first the slaves rebelled against the Cosway family, then Antoinette rebelled against her husband\n    *   Antoinette’s dream was in a way **foreshadowed** by** Coco flying into the flames**\n        *   The wings area symbol of **independence**, and Antoinette did not have any, so she thought that she was better off dead\n        *   Through suicide she gains freedom and betrays Rochester\n2. Red dress\n    *   The red dress triggers many memories (that were left out earlier in the narration) for Antoinette\n        *   For example, her and Sandi’s relation: he also asked her if she wanted to elope and they often kissed\n        *   She does not share this with Grace Poole, reinforcing her distrust of her\n    *   Her red dress comes in stark contrast to the white dress of the white girl she saw (Jane Eyre)\n        *   The dress symbolizes passion\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n1. Similarities between Rochester and Antoinette\n    *   Both are delusional and both were neglected at childhood and then forced to marry; both like rum – it allowed them to escape reality\n    *   They were alcoholics as they did not have work at the plantation because no more slaves, so the only thing to do was drink. This created a state of disarray as the transition from slaves to no slaves was very abrupt\n2. Marriage\n    *   There is some hypocrisy: Rochester received money as a dowry in marrying Antoinette, while Amelie paid Rochester money to have sex with him\n    *   The first one is socially acceptable and the other one is socially unacceptable\n3. Names\n    *   After starting at the tapestry hanging on her wall for a long time, she starts seeing her mother, but doesn't tell Grace about it – she is hallucinating and slowly losing her sanity\n        *   She feels disconnected from her identity\n    *   She also notes that “Grace” does not fit Grace Poole, and seems to have a distrust of her\n4. Antoinette’s death; shouting Tia\n    *   When she jumps into the fire, she decides to shout Tia’s name\n\n\n# More notes\n\n\n## Slavery\n\n\n\n*   In Wide Sargasso Sea, the Emancipation act led to the freedom of the slaves\n*   But slavery also exists between husband and wife, as seen by Antoinette and her husband: this is a different type of slavery\n*   Slavery also extends to post-colonial slavery\n    *   Antoinette’s husband tells Christophe that he will turn her for her Obeah practices\n    *   This suppression continues even after the Emancipation act\n\n\n## Burning of houses\n\n\n\n*   Two houses burned down in the novel\n*   The burning of the houses is a symbolism and parallelism\n    *   First the slaves burned the house to avenge themselves\n    *   It is implied that Antoinette, at the end of the novel, burns her husband’s house down to escape\n        *   She killed herself in the process, so she lays down her life in the hope to be free and destroy her husband\n        *   She shows her agency by doing this\n\n\n## Antoinette’s agency\n\n\n\n*   She tries to \n\n\n# Themes\n\n\n## Identity\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette does not fit in anywhere as she is a creole English\n    *   She is neither Jamaican nor from England, so she feels like an outsider, and others also treat her like one\n*   Chrisophone, on the other hand is portrayed as Caribbean, while Antoinette does not fit it anywhere\n\n\n## Slavery and freedom\n\n\n\n*   Conflict is created between the newly emancipated slaves and their owners\n    *   Their interactions lead to the bringdown of the Coulibri\n\n\n## Power\n\n\n\n*   Chrisotophone has access to Obeah\n*   Rochester has the power to change Antoinette’s name\n\n\n## Money\n\n\n## Women and power\n\n\n\n*   The female characters in Wide Sargasso Sea were confronted by societal forces that prevent them from acting and sustaining themselves\n*   The only socially acceptable ways for a woman to attain security were marriage and entering the convert \n*   In Annette’s case, the marriage destroyed not only hers, but also her children’s lives\n    *   Alexander Cosway, the first husband had many affairs publicly, and therefore many bastard children\n    *   When he died, he left the family destitute\n    *   He ignored her pleas to move out, which ended up killing Pierre and causing her to descend to madness\n    *   Antoinette was forced to marry Rochester by Mr Mason for money: this marriage was only done for financial benefit to Rochester and Mr Mason; he essentially sold her\n*   Rochester sleeps with Amelie, without making any effort to hide it from Antoinette, while still on their honeymoon\n*   The female characters who embody strength and agency are those who decide to remain outside the control of men/husbands\n    *   One example is Christophone\n        *   Christophine was respected in her community for her expertise in Obeah, and Antoinette also depended on her\n        *   She states that “Women must have spunks to live in this wicked world”, and ““All women, all colours, nothing but fools. Three children I have. One living in this world, each one a different father, but no husband, I thank my God. I keep my money. I don’t give it to no worthless man”\n    *   Auto Cora is a widow who does not remarry\n        *   She was relatively stable, and able to control her health and movements\n        *   She also promises safety for Antoinette \n*   Amelie is a minor character who also demonstrates that power can be with those outside traditional marriages\n    *   She manipulates sex to exercise to gain control over her employers, so she sleeps with and receives money from Rochester\n    *   She also says that she plans to move to Rio to continue the same tactic: “She wanted to go to Rio. There were rich men in Rio”\n\n\n## Horror novel\n\n\n\n*   Wide Sargasso Sea explores ideas of domestic abuse and cruelty\n*   For example, rochester renames Antoinette\n    *   Antoinette first has a name, then it is taken from her. This shows how she lost her identity to the unnamed character\n    *   He renames her Bertha, just like a slave-owner renaming its possessions, in order to assert his dominance, and distance himesend from her heritage and alleged madness\n    *   He has also taken her money, property, sense of security, emotional happiness, secual dignity, and finally her name\n    *   He calls her laugh a “crazy laugh”, which justifies in his delusion, his abuse of her\n    *   He also pretends to believe that she has harmed him: “You deceived me, betrayed me”\n    *   He also reduced her to a “doll” and a “marionette”, a plaything and object to be manipulated\n    *   At the end, he describes her as if he is on the perpetrator of her destruction: “only a ghost … nothing left but hopelessness”\n    *   He also makes sure he can never get away from her: “She’s mad but mine … my lunatic.

<em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em> is in <strong>response</strong> to that book\n<ul>\n<li><em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em> provides an explanation for why the madwoman exists in the first place</li>\n<li>In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, there is only one narrative account in her name, and although she was marginalized for being poor, she didn't suffer from the racial implications</li>\n<li>For her, the madwoman is just crazy, and she doesn’t go into details to why she is mad\n<ul>\n<li>To JE, the madwoman (Antoinette) is a villain in her happiness</li>\n<li>So JR provides multiple reasons why the “madwomen” even exists, and why she is locked up</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part 1: Antoinette</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In Jane Eyre, Bertha Mason’s story is told from the perspective of the narrator, Jane Eyre, who views her as the ‘madwomen’</li>\n<li>In this novel, she gets to voice her own experience</li>\n<li>In the story, we see her change from child to adolescent</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unreliable narrator</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The narration makes the readers feel “closer” to the storyteller as she expressed her inner thoughts, feelings, and also dreams however this makes us as the readers less critical and blind to her faults as it is easier to sympathize for her</li>\n<li>Her story is full of gaps and silence, and also secrets\n<ul>\n<li>There are certain parts of the story she chooses not to disclose</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stream of consciousness</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows the mingling of a child’s perspective to the older narrator's memories</li>\n<li>As she watches Pierre sleep, she reflects on Mr Mason’s plans, the future, and the bamboos</li>\n<li>All these descriptions come in sharp contrast to the events yet to come</li>\n<li>At the beginning, most of the events happen in order but later, it is left to the readers understand as if they are a part of the story</li>\n<li>Stream of consciousness also reflects on her uncertainties: this is seen through her lack of traditional sentence structures, and lack of formal dialogues\n<ul>\n<li>Her thoughts are <strong>disjointed</strong> as there are gaps in understanding and narration</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She is only recollecting various disconnected thoughts, and sharing her personal thoughts: this gives the reader a glimpse into her mind as she does not share everything</li>\n<li>There are many gaps in the narrative (makes her an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong>)\n<ul>\n<li>One gap was after the burning down of the Coulibri\n<ul>\n<li>The gap shows that she feels shocked and is in a state of bewilderment or fear</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There was a minor gap after Annett asks her whose dress she was wearing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part 2: Antoinette’s husband</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Her husband also receives his own point of view and in the story this allows for\n<ul>\n<li>Different points of view on his experienced and relathips offered to readers</li>\n<li>Readers to feel closer to his experience, and not only Antoinette’s</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Similar to Antoinette, he also has dislocated experienced of\n<ul>\n<li>New cultural experienced</li>\n<li>Intense sensual effects of the world</li>\n<li>Sexual passion</li>\n<li>Memory and relations with family</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>JR uses a range of narrative techniques for representing the confused responses to the world and people around him</li>\n<li>His first person narrative is manipulated to reveal is precarious sense of his own identity</li>\n<li>The setting is <strong>overwhelming</strong> to him, and he feels disconnected</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stream of consciousness</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>His stream of consciousness makes the novel <strong>less</strong> <strong>biased</strong>, and it introduces the idea of Antoinette’s voice being <strong>muted</strong>, which is further emphasized by the setting change (England, a place Antoinette doesn't feel comfortable in)</li>\n<li>There are often differences in what he things and what he says</li>\n<li>He has many cultural confusions</li>\n<li>He does not understand the colonizers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Daniel cosway</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>He provides many of the details Antoinette never told Rochester</li>\n<li>However, he does not mention the fire at the Coulibri that lead to Annette's grief and hence madness</li>\n<li>He is therefore an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part 3: Grace Poole and Antoinette</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The first italicized part is by Grace Poole, Antoinette’s jailer</li>\n<li>The second part is narrated by Antoinette, who is now the “madwoman in the attic”</li>\n<li>She employs <strong>stream of consciousness</strong> through inner monologue</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Other characters are also given their own stories, although not through first-person narratives</li>\n<li>We only hear their voice through dialogs, letters</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Annette</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We get Antoinette’s memories of her, her dialogs reported by Antoinette, gossip and comments of servants and other family members, and information given to Rochester by Daniel Cosway And Christophine</li>\n<li>Her descriptions can be contradictory as Antoinette is an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n<li>Antoinette doesn't describe her mother’s decline until she is forced to explain her family history to Rochester in Part 2\n<ul>\n<li>This also shows that they were never close (expanded below)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Aunt Cora and Mr Mason</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s memories, speech and dialog, gossip</li>\n<li>We also get conflicted opinions of them</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>White community</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s speech often slips into recounting local white gossip about her family</li>\n<li>This method of narration ensures that the voice remains hers, but also reveals the values and attitudes of the white community to which she belongs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Christophine</h3>\n<p>Her character is constructed from</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s first person narrative: her importance as an influence is demonstrated by the amount of attention she is given in Antoinette’s memories\n<ul>\n<li>Her appearance, manner, and personality are carefully described early in Part 1.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gossip and fragments of dialog retold by Antoinette reveal the attitudes of other people</li>\n<li>Rochester’s POV: he initially sees her as a servant, but he ends up treating her with hostility once he suspects her of using obeah practices on him\n<ul>\n<li>Although the part is narrated by Rochester, she is given her own voice by inserting sections of dialog, in which she confronts Rochester in a very dramatic way.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Letter from Mr Frazer to Rochester: we see an opinion on her held by the judicial element within the white community</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Daniel Cosway</h3>\n<p>He is represented within Rochester's first person narration</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Letters; he sends two letters to Rochester in which he presents his perspective on Antoinette’s family background, which Fuels Rochester's suspensions about insanity</li>\n<li>Dialog: his speech is reported by Rochester\n<ul>\n<li>He can command in different styles of speech with rhetorical and biblical resonances</li>\n<li>He modulates into more natural styles of speech later</li>\n<li>However, his dialog is presented by Rochester, and is therefore colored by his perspective.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He is also an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Black servants and the blacks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mainly reported through speech and dialog in Antoinette’s narration</li>\n<li>The wider black community is notably silent in the novel</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Structure</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>There are two main narrators: <strong>Antoinette’s husband</strong> (unnamed) and <strong>Antoinette</strong>, creating a duality of antagonist and protagonist: this creates dichotomy as both are protagonists during the time they narrate the story</li>\n<li>This dichotomy creates a <strong>contrast</strong> in personality, themes, and cultures</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conflict of cultures and characters</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette is part of the West Indies culture while Rochester comes from a patriarchal, colonial power</li>\n<li>We see the differences in their ideologies: Antoinette likes nature and prefers to be in the garden while Rochester says: “I hated the mountains and the hills, the rivers and the rain. I hated the sunsets of whatever colour, I hated its beauty and it’s magic and the secret I would never know.” Whatever Antoinette describes evokes sympathy and emotion, while Rochester finds the sun and vibrant colors overwhelming: he does not understand interrelations of black and white</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contrast of themes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Need to finish</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why is the book divided into different parts?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To show the flow of time: from childhood, to adolescence, and then a sudden shift to marriage</li>\n<li>To show a shift in her mental status\n<ul>\n<li>To show that she tries to find security, but fails to do so\n<ul>\n<li>In Part 2, she tries to find security, but fails to do so</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sympathies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In Part 1, we are sympathetic to Antoinette</li>\n<li>In Part 2, we are still sympathetic towards her\n<ul>\n<li>But we get to know her story through her husband, so it is counter-intuitive that we do not sympathize for the narrator</li>\n<li>Although we see all his thoughts and motives, we don't sympathize for him</li>\n<li>Even after known that he a victim of parental influence and manipulation (forced marriage), we don't sympathize for him</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Part 1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Narrated by Antoinette; she describes her childhood</li>\n<li>There is little flow in the stories with many skips between events as she recollects; one event does not lead to another</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<h2>Characters</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Antoinette\n<ul>\n<li>Her childhood experiences have shaped her character: she receives no comfort or love from her mother, and is <strong>mocked in the society for her origins</strong>, something she cannot control\n<ul>\n<li>She is constantly compared to her mother too (in a bad way), which is, again, something which is out of reach: “Look the crazy girl, you like your mother … She have eyes like zombi and you have eyes like zombi too”</li>\n<li>This also foreshadows that she will end up like her mother</li>\n<li>It also shows that others don't see her as a human being because she is of a different race.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Her one true friend or solace she found ended up joining the society in mocking her after stealing from her\n<ul>\n<li>This, in a way, caused her to be determined to be away from people, as she was neglected, and Tia betrayed her</li>\n<li>We found out early on that her mother was not fond of her as she ignored her and seldom talked to her, so Antoinette gradually started to avoid people</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Similar to the Garden (symbol), she was <strong>left (neglected) to grow wild</strong>, with no care or guidance\n<ul>\n<li>She was rejected by her mother</li>\n<li>She also states that the company of the grasses was “better, better than people” – it is clear that she was <strong>neglected</strong> as a child</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After the remarriage, she finds her own home <strong>alienating</strong> as she has a new fear of Christophine and her practices of Obeah, although she grew up trusting her\n<ul>\n<li>This fear is based off of gossip she hears in the wedding, and she is struggling to determine what is true</li>\n<li>We feel sympathetic towards her as she feels unsafe in her own home</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After her dress is stolen by Tia, Christophine argues with Annette about how she doesn't have any more dresses: “She run wild, she grow up worthless. And nobody care”</li>\n<li>She is highly emotional and easily feels afraid and hatred, but learns to conceal it after numerous traumatic incidents in her life\n<ul>\n<li>She was forced to conceal her fears and emotions as she was neglected</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She often decides not to talk about certain ideas: she decides not to verbalize certain things in the hope that they are not true\n<ul>\n<li>When the horse died, and when they became “marooned”, she did not tell anyone in the hope that it was not true</li>\n<li>Also, when Mr Mason mentions a suitor, she gets a feeling of insecurity as she will lose her freedom, but she decides to ignore it in the hope that ignoring it will make it disappear\n<ul>\n<li>she understands the <strong>suffocating</strong> truths of marriage, as she has seen them in her mother</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Annette\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette spends most of her early narration describing her mother, and see her progression from a beautiful Creole women who is ostracized by the society to a quite “thin” women who has lost any hope to live</li>\n<li>She finally descends to madness after the fire, and learning that Pierre is dead; she loses all hopes and fears and to her death is the best way out\n<ul>\n<li>She has become disconnected from herself and her emotions as she has lost everything: her husband, her status (after the Emancipation act), and her son, so she chooses her ignore her family and try to escape it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We see her signs of instability when she “speaks aloud to herself”, although the arrival of the Luttrell's gives her a new hope</li>\n<li>She is never able to reconnect with Antoinette and wants to leave the past behind</li>\n<li>The fact that her death/funeral is not described in detail shows the distance between Antoinette and Annette\n<ul>\n<li>We actually only understands what happens to the mother when she described it to Rochester; this shows the disconnect between Antoinette and her mother</li>\n<li>Information about her that is unrevealed comes to readers through gossip, such as her death</li>\n<li>This shows that Antoinette thought that it wasn't important anymore as she neglected her so much during childhood – their disconnect is clear</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She foreshadows her daughter’s future as she goes insane as a result of what her husband did\n<ul>\n<li>The similarity between their names also foreshadows that they will have similar lives.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We later learn in Part 2 that she was sexualy abused by the caretakesr, but Antoinette was unable to mention it because of the trauma she was going through\n<ul>\n<li>She also refused to describe it in the hopes that it did not actually happen</li>\n<li>The caretakers were black, and shows a role reversal as usually the white slave owners would force sexual relationships with the black slaves before emancipation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Christophine\n<ul>\n<li>She is the one person who stands by Antoinette’s side, and she teaches her the importance of her Creole heritage and to be proud of it through her songs</li>\n<li>She herself expresses her heritage boldy through the way she dresses, but still tries to fit in by maintaining her accent</li>\n<li>She is feared by the locals as she practises obeah</li>\n<li>“She was your father's wedding present”: she was a freed slave, and she shows loyalty to Annette and her family and does not abandon them</li>\n<li>She is very close to Anette, she even says “Some people say/think [Annette] crazy” when Annette does not understand how poor they are\n<ul>\n<li>This also suggests the intimacy of their relationship</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After the coulibri is renovated, Antoinette has a new fear of her due to obeah\n<ul>\n<li>Because of this and the new servants combined with her neglecting mother, she finds her new home very alienating.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tia\n<ul>\n<li>She is the representative of the society to Antoinette</li>\n<li>Before making friends with Antoinette, she insulted her</li>\n<li>When Antoinette decides to go live with her, Tia throws a rock at her forehead, showing that she was never accepted by her</li>\n<li>She bettered Antoinette in greed for money and through of her as a “white nigger”; she also taunts Antoinette by saying “we ate salt fish”\n<ul>\n<li>She means to say that because Antoinette is so poor, she cannot afford fresh fish</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She could be one of the driving forces in Antoinette’s life because she constantly mentions her name (in dreams and later in the book)</li>\n<li>She stole Antoinette's clothes and hence her identity</li>\n<li>Although they got along, money drew them apart again\n<ul>\n<li>The childish bet and disagreement reflects the socio-economic disparity between the whites and the blacks</li>\n<li>The fact the Tia steals Antoinette’s dress and her money highlights the symbolic significance of appearance and attire in female power and security in the novel.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mr Mason\n<ul>\n<li>He is a representative of the white slave owners, a wealthy plantation owner</li>\n<li>He portrays the theme of ignorance as he does not take Annette seriously about moving out; he is self-centered as he wants to make more money\n<ul>\n<li>He does not see Annette’s point of view because he does not understand racial relations on the island (similar to Rochester)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He is a new breed of the white men as he is cunning and bends laws to fit them to his liking: although the Emancipation Act ended the reign of slave owners, neo-colonialism takes place</li>\n<li>Although Annette has no money, he still married her because he found her beautiful, but when he discovers that she is mentally ill, he locks her up in inhuman conditions\n<ul>\n<li>The fact that Annette and Antoinette are similar foreshadows that even Antoinette will end up in similar conditions</li>\n<li>Sending Antoinette to be married can be similar to being locked up as she is sent against her will as she did not get a choice</li>\n<li>In the end, she ended up getting locked up too: both their lives ended in similar ways</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He has a dislike towards Aunt Cora as she did not help their family during the time of need (find page)\n<ul>\n<li>Furthermore, she was a successful woman, and saying that he dislikes her makes him superior as he is a man and hence he holds more power.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He misunderstands the locals and does not understand how dangerous they can be: “They're too damn lazy to be dangerous”, “They are children––they wouldn't hurt a fly”, “handful of drunken negroes”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Pierre\n<ul>\n<li>He “staggered when he walked and couldn't speak distinctly”; he is mentally disabled</li>\n<li>He is later described as an idiot to Rochester by Daniel Cosway the bastard\n<ul>\n<li>Rochester thought that the disease was genetic when it was not, so he thought Antoinette was also crazy like him</li>\n<li>This can be linked to ADH: Dr. Rank’s diseases</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Annette “changed” after hearing the doctor about Pierre’s conditions, suggesting that it was an incurable disease, that was likely a burden for the family</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mr Luttrell\n<ul>\n<li>Kills his dog and goes to the sea never to come back\n<ul>\n<li>He has no money</li>\n<li>After the Emancipation Act, he had nothing</li>\n<li>He is a white male who was lost</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He was in a state of despair following the Emancipation Act</li>\n<li>His death sets the mood for the rest of the events, the mood of <strong>despair and disillusionment</strong></li>\n<li>His death gives Antoinette the troubled ideas of freedom</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Sandi Cosway\n<ul>\n<li>She is Antoinette’s black cousin: “I knew who he was, his name was Sandi, Alexander Cosway’s son. Once I would have said ‘my cousin Sandi’ but Mr Mason’s lectures had made me shy about my coloured relatives”</li>\n<li>Mr Mason and his Superior Englishman attitude influenced Antoinette with Sandi Cosway\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette understood that Mr Mason would not accept any friendship/relationship between her and Sandi</li>\n<li>Mr Mason disliked Antoinette’s creole family (including Aunt Cora)</li>\n<li>Mr Mason is also representative of the English society and their mindset, so the difference in skin color is a barrier that keeps the two apart: this social barrier is heavily linked to racial differences, which had heightened during this time period after the Emancipation Act</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Themes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Isolation and ostracizing based on races, and racial discrimination; alienation\n<ul>\n<li>Creoles are seen as being in between as they are not black or white, and are therefore not accepted in the society</li>\n<li>Antoinette refers to non-creoles using the word “<strong>they</strong>” showing a disconnect and clear distinction between the two; this word is used quite early on in the novel suggestion animosity between blacks and whites in Jamaica</li>\n<li>The fact that the family had to “[persuade] a Spanish Town doctor to visit” Pierre demonstrates the tension between the whites and blacks</li>\n<li>The racial hierarchy in the 1830s in Jamaica was complex and strained with tensions between whites and creoles\n<ul>\n<li>There was resentment which lead to hatred and violence such as the Cosways being referred to as “<strong>white cockroaches</strong>”, and eventually being driven away from their homes from their former selves</li>\n<li>These dynamics are also complicated by exclusion based on race, geographical origin, appearance, wealth, and status.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Major characters in the novel are defined by their inclusion or exclusion from cultural groups\n<ul>\n<li>Although Antoinette and the Cosways where white, they were not the dominant group of Jamaica as they were creoles.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Alienation leads to the characters of the novel being destructive too: Anette, driven by her family’s exclusions from white society, seeks marriage to Mr Mason, and this ultimately leads to the loss of her son and hence her sanity.</li>\n<li>From the beginning, we see that Antoinette’s family is dysfunctional, and she is quite isolated because of this</li>\n<li>The love marriage of Cosway was not happy as he had many bastard children with other women</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Internal isolation from family and neglect\n<ul>\n<li>This is one of the most prominent themes in the novel, and highly relates to Antoinette: she was constantly neglected from her mother, whose voice was neglected by Mr Mason</li>\n<li>It was because of neglect that Annette was cast as an outsider, which leads to her mental breakdown</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Effect of the Emancipation Act on the society\n<ul>\n<li>The Emancipation Act of 1833 leaves discontent and violence as seen in Mr Luttrell, a white former slave owner, who commited suicide as he was unable to adjust to the new social and economic landscape.</li>\n<li>Although the Emancipation Act freed slaves, slave owners suffered as shown by the Cosway family. For example, at Coulibri, the local population of black former slaves are deeply angry. Antoinette also says “They hated us”. She was also called a “white cockroach, go away, go away. Nobody want you”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ignorance and money, the reason Mr Mason did not want to leave</li>\n<li>Women and power\n<ul>\n<li>Annette wanted to leave the Coulibri, but was unable to as she couldn't convince Mr Mason\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to how the bird’s wings were clipped, she has a lack of independence in the marriage: the bird’s wings are a metaphor for her independence which is being diminished by Mr Mason</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The garden\n<ul>\n<li>The garden at the Coulibri is a symbol of life, or eventually Antoinette as it too runs wild because it is uncared for</li>\n<li>Antoinette finds comfort in the moss of the garden and enjoys wondering about the unexplored areas\n<ul>\n<li>She was <strong>forced</strong> to find comfort in the garden because she was <strong>neglected</strong> by annette, her mother.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Although she finds beauty in the overgrown orchids, she is afraid to go near them</li>\n<li>Different parts of the garden may present her qualities and her desires</li>\n<li>Antoinette described the garden with many bright colors: “green, white, purple”; she loves these colors and mentions them many times, while Rochester dislikes them and prefers brown and white instead</li>\n<li>“Snakey” looking is a biblical allusion to the snake, which is likely overgrown?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fire\n<ul>\n<li>In the novel, fire represents <strong>freedom and rebellion</strong> (Part 1, page 21, 22, and the end of Part 3)</li>\n<li>The ex-slaves set fire to the Coulibri as an act of <strong>defiance</strong> after being free following the Emancipation Act</li>\n<li>“So black and white, they burn the same, eh? (23)”: this, in a way, unites the whites and the blacks</li>\n<li>Furthermore, at the end of the play, it is suggested that Antoinette committed suicide with fire. In Jane Eyre, Antoinette (Bertha) commits suicide with fire, hence it symbolizes her <strong>rebellion</strong> in order to escape her husband</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hair\n<ul>\n<li>It is a symbol of the female characters’ agency and identity</li>\n<li>At the time of the fire, Annette’s mother had disheveled hair, showing that she is not taken seriously and that her identity doesn't mean anything to Mr Mason</li>\n<li>The fact that Antoinette’s hair has been cut without her knowledge foreshadows that she will slowly lose her identity and agency (This is true because her husband gives her a new name, Bertha, hence she loses her identity, and she also loses her freedom and has to follow her husband's orders)\n<ul>\n<li>Her identity is also being lost as she has lost her father and brother, and her mother is soon to die.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Eventually, Rochester calls her Bertha, which is not her real name\n<ul>\n<li>This is shows that she has lost her identity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Clothes\n<ul>\n<li>Symbolizes wealth, but only temporary in Part 1</li>\n<li>Clothes and money are divided: as Tia steals the dress</li>\n<li>Link to ADH: the <strong>tarantella dress</strong> is symbol/motif and is linked to <strong>objectification</strong> of women</li>\n<li>However, the removal of dresses in ADH heads to empowerment for the women while it is (bad for Antoinette)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Beginning racism\n<ul>\n<li>It is a powerful opening beginning with racism: “the Jamaican ladies had never approved of my mother” – the beginning shows that they were excluded socially\n<ul>\n<li>Many people had criticized her mother for being a widow</li>\n<li>This shows that in order for women to be successful, they had to have a man as they had a <strong>lack of agency</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The fallout between Tia and Antoinette was because of a racial tension, and it also foreshadows the relation with her husband</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Women and agency\n<ul>\n<li>Women with a husband/partner have a lack of agency when compared to those who decided not to marry</li>\n<li>This is evident in the case of Annette: she married twice and has a lack of agency and ends up being locked up</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Antoinette’s many dreams (pages 11 and 34)\n<ul>\n<li>Dreams are prevalent in Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea, in which they give us views of expressed and <strong>unexpressed emotions</strong>, and they <strong>foreshadow</strong> certain events</li>\n<li>Dreams in Wide Sargasso Sea contain <strong>parallel imagery</strong> to the dreams of Jane Eyre; the dreams on Antoinette are <strong>clairvoyant</strong> like Jane’s dreams, which reflect on a part of her consciousness</li>\n<li>In the novel, Antoinette has three dreams which are essentially of the same event, and they give us insight onto Antoinette’s maturing character and provide foreshadow</li>\n<li>The first dream is in her childhood when Tia steals her pennies and dress: “I dreamed that I was walking in the forest. Not alone. Someone who hated me was with me, out of sight. I could hear heavy footsteps coming closer and though I struggled and screamed, I could not move. I woke crying.”\n<ul>\n<li>This reflects on the young Antoinette's <strong>undeveloped sense of self-awareness</strong></li>\n<li>The fact that it is in the <strong>past tense</strong> suggests that Antoinette is distances from her dream consciousness, and the vagueness of the threat in her dream suggests that she herself does not understand her fears</li>\n<li>“Safe from the strangers”\n<ul>\n<li>Unknown what she is scared of</li>\n<li>Does not understand her fears</li>\n<li>Rudimentary dream which develops later</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Both Antoinette’s and Jane’s dreams are recurring: Antoinette had her “bad dream” again at the age of seventeen when Mr Mason tells her that he is arranging for suitors to visit her</li>\n<li>“Again I have left the house at Coulibri. It is still night and I am walking towards the forest. I am wearing a long dress and thin slippers, so I walk with difficulty, following the man who is with me and holding up the skirt of my dress. It is white and beautiful and I don't wish to get it soiled. I follow him, sick with fear but I make no effort to save myself; if anyone were to try to save me, I would refuse. This must happen. Now we have reached the forest. We are under the tall dark trees and there is no wind. &quot;Here?&quot; He turns and looks at me, his face black with hatred, and when I see this I begin to cry. He smiles slyly. &quot;Not here, not yet,&quot; he says, and I follow him, weeping. Now I do not try to hold up my dress, it trails in the dirt, my beautiful dress. We are no longer in the forest but in an enclosed garden surrounded by a stone wall and the trees are different trees. I do not know them. There are steps leading upwards. It is too dark to see the wall or the steps, but I know they are there and I think, &quot;It will be when I go up these steps. At the top.&quot; I stumble over my dress and cannot get up. I touch a tree and my arms hold on to it. 'Here, here.' But I think I will not go any further. The tree sways and jerks as if it is trying to throw me off.

to her dream consciousness</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the plot of the second dream is more <strong>clear</strong>, suggesting greater <strong>intelligence and perception</strong>, whereas the first one is <strong>vague</strong> with terms such as: “walking in the forest” with “someone who hated me”\n<ul>\n<li>She understands that there is a “man” who is “black with hatred”</li>\n<li>This could show how she is maturing and hence understands her problems much better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The fact that she attempts to keep the dress unsoiled demonstrates her concern with maintaining sexual purity\n<ul>\n<li>It also shows that she is submissive towards him, which she is (in the future)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This dream foreshadows the problems she will soon face with Rochester: the pure dress represents a wedding dress and the man with “hatred” represents Rochester, and her reluctance to join him symbolizes her reluctance to join Rochester</li>\n<li>Later in the book, she blindly listens to Rochester and performs sexual intimacy (she “masochistically and insistently lays herself on [the] sexual altar” and complies to all his orders) and “[makes] no effort to save [herself]”</li>\n<li>“Smile slyly”: Rochester, stays with her just to maintain property and money, shows how detrimental marriage is to her</li>\n<li>She trips on dress and unable to get up = marriage

marriage or the convent school\n<ul>\n<li>The convent was quite patriarchal, and Antoinette struggled to adjust there</li>\n<li>She struggled to fit as the convert was based off of religion, which is opposed to black magic, which she grew up with Christophine</li>\n<li>Therefore, the convent creates an identity crisis</li>\n<li>Antoinette learns that women must be with men at the convent school, and she is trained to be a good wife: this relates to the theme of <strong>women and freedom</strong> as women had to live their life being in control of men, by learning how to please

from his <strong>point of view</strong>, and although he is inhuman, his actions are explained by his suffering, confusion and feelings of alienation</li>\n<li>He is also distant from Antoinette and treats her like a stranger and analyzes her appearance critically (in a bad way)\n<ul>\n<li>He also misunderstands her local culture and considers her language inferior</li>\n<li>His detachment from heirs cleaner, so he critically evaluates her without feeling any emotions for her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It is also implied that he is detached from her own family</li>\n<li>He carelessly crushes the wedding wreaths: this foreshadows that he will treat the marriage carelessly</li>\n<li>When he and her try to connect, the differences are made more clear and his only way to understand her is to compare her to an english girl: she ”might have been any pretty English girl”</li>\n<li>Unlike Antoinette, he feels alienated and threatened by landscape and nature.</li>\n<li>There is a clear difference between his and Antoinette’s structure in terms of emotional expression\n<ul>\n<li>He sees Baptiste looking mournful and finds the Caribbean way of displaying emotions as weak and vulnerable as compared to the English way of hiding and concealing emotions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Of the wedding, he only remembers the marble and Antoinette’s <strong>cold hands</strong> (“It was cold as ice in the hot sun (47)”), suggesting that he feels no love of feelings/emotions for her at all</li>\n<li>One reason why he is <strong>disoriented</strong> and dislikes Antoinette with passion is because for him, she is emblematic of the Jamaican landscape, which he doesn't not enjoy as he dislikes the landscape and nature, as opposed to Antoinette, who finds comfort in nature.</li>\n<li>After seeing the letter (28), he gets lost in the forest, this can be related to Antoinette's dream\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike Antoinette, he is not well-versed with nature so he gets lost easily</li>\n<li>He also has less of an appeal to other people, so the girl was scared of him, and this is reinforced as he did not even realize/recognize Baptise looking for him, although it could have been because he was quite disoriented</li>\n<li>This comes in stark contrast to Antoinette’s dream at the end of Part 1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There is sexual tension between him and Amélie,

relationship</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We never see him working; he is living off the money he earned as a slave owner</li>\n<li>He has limited power as compared to other english men as he was the second son\n<ul>\n<li>He had no choice; he was forced to listen to his father</li>\n<li>But he still made his own (bad, incorrect) choices like cheating on Antoinette when he could have been a better husband, so readers do not sympathize for him (even though we see everything from his point of view)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He wants to care for Antoinette, but decides not to due to his bitter feelings\n<ul>\n<li>He also does not care for the boy who learned English in the hopes of staying with him</li>\n<li>When the boy cries like that, he feels he is crying “for nothing”, reiterating the fact that he shows no remorse</li>\n<li>After a struggle between compassion and bitterness, bitterness has taken over completely</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Daniel Cosway\n<ul>\n<li>He is another character similar to Antoinette who has led a life of inherited suffering\n<ul>\n<li>His is likely her half-brother, a result of Cosway and a slave</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>While Antoinette is culturally different from everyone else around her, Daniel is racially different as he has a black mother and white father</li>\n<li>Daniel is a bastard son, similar to Antoinette who was rejected as

white colonists would have all the servants do work for them</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the writer only wants to represent the point of view of Antoinette, so giving him a name and hence an identity is difficult and will go against the main point in the novel</li>\n<li>It is deeply <strong>ironic</strong> that the <strong>unnamed</strong> character robbed the main characters of her name and her identity: although he is unnamed, he holds power as he is a man</li>\n<li>He also wants to distance himself from her</li>\n<li>Not giving him a name essentially generalizes him and all other white colonial men</li>\n<li>On the other hand, women are individualized, as Antoinette is given a name and also given more emphasis to as this is a feminist novel</li>\n<li>The story is also mainly through the feminine perspective, and his name is not mentioned so that Antoinette can occupy the center stage</li>\n<li>The fact that he is unnamed also creates a <strong>cold sense of unfamiliarity</strong> which allows to relate with Antoinette as she is also in anew place</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The letter from Daniel Cosway\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s husband says that he was expecting the letter, and this shows that he never truly loved her: “I felt no surprise.

This created a state of disarray as the transition from slaves to no slaves was very abrupt</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Marriage\n<ul>\n<li>There is some hypocrisy: Rochester received money as a dowry in marrying Antoinette, while Amelie paid Rochester money to have sex with him</li>\n<li>The first one is socially acceptable and the other one is socially unacceptable</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Names\n<ul>\n<li>After starting at the tapestry hanging on her wall for a long time, she starts seeing her mother, but doesn't tell Grace about it – she is hallucinating and slowly losing her sanity\n<ul>\n<li>She feels disconnected from her identity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She also notes that “Grace” does not fit Grace Poole, and seems to have a distrust of her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Antoinette’s death; shouting Tia\n<ul>\n<li>When she jumps into the fire, she decides to shout Tia’s name</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>More notes</h1>\n<h2>Slavery</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In Wide Sargasso Sea, the Emancipation act led to the freedom of the slaves</li>\n<li>But slavery also exists between husband and wife, as seen by Antoinette and her husband: this is a different type of slavery</li>\n<li>Slavery also extends to post-colonial slavery\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s husband tells Christophe that he will turn her for her Obeah practices</li>\n<li>This suppression continues even after the Emancipation act</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Burning of houses</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Two houses burned down in the novel</li>\n<li>The burning of the houses is a symbolism and parallelism\n<ul>\n<li>First the slaves burned the house to avenge themselves</li>\n<li>It is implied that Antoinette, at the end of the novel, burns her husband’s house down to escape\n<ul>\n<li>She killed herself in the process, so she lays down her life in the hope to be free and destroy her husband</li>\n<li>She shows her agency by doing this</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Antoinette’s agency</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>She tries to</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Themes</h1>\n<h2>Identity</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette does not fit in anywhere as she is a creole English\n<ul>\n<li>She is neither Jamaican nor from England, so she feels like an outsider, and others also treat her like one</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Chrisophone, on the other hand is portrayed as Caribbean, while Antoinette does not fit it anywhere</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Slavery and freedom</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Conflict is created between the newly emancipated slaves and their owners\n<ul>\n<li>Their interactions lead to the bringdown of the Coulibri</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Power</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Chrisotophone has access to Obeah</li>\n<li>Rochester has the power to change Antoinette’s name</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Money</h2>\n<h2>Women and power</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The female characters in Wide Sargasso Sea were confronted by societal forces that prevent them from acting and sustaining themselves</li>\n<li>The only socially acceptable ways for a woman to attain security were marriage and entering the convert</li>\n<li>In Annette’s case, the marriage destroyed not only hers, but also her children’s lives\n<ul>\n<li>Alexander Cosway, the first husband had many affairs publicly, and therefore many bastard children</li>\n<li>When he died, he left the family destitute</li>\n<li>He ignored her pleas to move out, which ended up killing Pierre and causing her to descend to madness</li>\n<li>Antoinette was forced to marry Rochester by Mr Mason for money: this marriage was only done for financial benefit to Rochester and Mr Mason; he essentially sold her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Rochester sleeps with Amelie, without making any effort to hide it from Antoinette, while still on their honeymoon</li>\n<li>The female characters who embody strength and agency are those who decide to remain outside the control of men/husbands\n<ul>\n<li>One example is Christophone\n<ul>\n<li>Christophine was respected in her community for her expertise in Obeah, and Antoinette also depended on her</li>\n<li>She states that “Women must have spunks to live in this wicked world”, and ““All women, all colours, nothing but fools.
