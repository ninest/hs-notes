Each of these symbols recur and foreshadow events that take place. The three symbols are the garden, fire, and hair.</p>
<p>The garden at Coulibri un a symbol of life. Antoinette, the protagonist of the novel, finds comfort in the moss of the garden and enjoys wondering about the unexplored areas. In fact, she also states that she enjoys being in the garden more than she enjoys the company of people. Although she finds beauty in the overgrown orchids, she does not go near them. She also described the bright colors of the garden: “green”, “white”, and “purple”. These colors demonstrate that she enjoys spending time in the garden. Additionally, it provides a contrast with the likes of Rochester, her husband, who does not like bright colors. The overgrown moss in the garden can also be considered a symbol of Antoinette’s coming of age. She is also uncared for similar to the garden.</p>
<p>Fire represents freedom and rebellion. Following the Emancipation Act which took place in 1833, there were tensions between slave owners and slaves. The slaves decided to rebel and go against the oppression they were put through by setting the Coulibri on fire. Furthermore, it is suggested that at the end, Antoinette commits suicide with fire. Not only is this an act of rebellion to her husband, who decided to lock her up, but it is also giving her freedom from him. In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Antoinette (Bertha) commits suicide by jumping into the fire. She does this to escape her husband.</p>
<p>The female characters’ hair is a symbol of their agency and identity. The fact that Antoinette's hair has been cut without her knowledge demonstrates that she is losing her identity. This is backed by the fact that she is slowly losing her family: her father and brother have died, and her mother is son to die. Eventually, Rochester calls her “Bertha”, showing that she has lost her identity.</p>
