children, he felt that rather than merely living together, the husband and wife should live as equals, free to become their own human beings\n*   However, critics attacked him for failing to respect the institution of marriage\n*   His writing created sensitive social issues and the Norwegian society frowned upon his work at first\n*   Father of Modern theater, he set out to develop serious ideas in a dramatic form\n\n\n## Context\n\n\n\n*   Set in Victorian Norway in 1879\n*   The protagonist is very much like a real life character, as we see her slowly transform into a new character (metamorphosis)\n*   By the end of the play, she is a woman fighting for her opinions and against her conventional husband: this makes her a complex character\n\n\n# Elements\n\n\n## Characters\n\n\n### Nora Helmer\n\n\n\n*   The protagonist of the play, she initially seems like a playful **naïve** child who lacks knowledge from the outside world, although we see later that she has experience of the outer world\n*   Her first word is “Hide”\n    *   This gives the audience an idea of her personality in nature of being secretive\n*   The **act of rebellion** with the macaroons indicates that she is **not** as innocent as she appears\n    *   The simple lie about eating the macaroons shows that she will lie when she needs to in order to escape certain situations\n*   She has a great **zest** (enthusiasm and energy): she takes pleasure in the Christmas tree, the taste of macaroons, and champagne\n    *   She is physically **expressive and at ease**, frequently kissing Helmer and playing affectionately with her children\n    *   Her instinct is to reach out to people, and we do see her reach out to the nurse, Mrs Linde, and Dr Rank\n*   When we see her tarantella performance, we see she is a natural performer, turning to dance as a means of **expressing what she cannot say** (because societal constructs prevent her), and this draws awareness that she is **‘performing’** the role of wife which society has scripted for her\n    *   Later in the play, she starts to feel a resentment that she has to perform in order to ask Helmer for anything, and she realizes that she is not in an **equal marriage**\n    *   Later in the play, she is able to see her position in the marriage with an increasing clarity and finds the **strength** and **agency** to free herself from the oppressive position\n*   At the start of the play, she responds affectionaley to Torvald’s teasing and is excited about the extra money she will get; she does not mind her doll-like existence in which she is pampered and patronized\n    *   But as the play progresses, we learn that she is not just a “**silly girl**” like Torvald calls her and she understands what business is\n    *   She is more **clever and manipulative** than Helmer thinks.\n*   The fact that Torvald is alive indicates that she is more intelligent that Torvald thinks she is, and her description of her secret labor undertaken to pay off her debt shows her **determination and ambition** to protect herself and her husband (protecting her husband from being in debt to her)\n    *   However, she is **naïve** in the sense that she thinks that the law will understand her motivation\n    *   But it remains: the fact that she was willing to break the law in order to ensure Torvald’s health shows her courage and love for him\n    *   However, later we learn that this **love is not mutual**, which is why she decides to leave him\n*   At the start, she does not know that she is participating in an **unequal** marriage\n    *   It is clear to the audience that the marriage is unequal as she does not even have a key to enter the house\n    *   Furthermore, she is reluctant to open or knock on the door of Helmer’s study, implying that she does not have a full access to the house\n*   Krogstad’s blackmail do not change Nora’s nature, rather they open her up to her unfulfilled and underappreciated potential: “I have been performing tricks for you, Torvald”; she has pretended to be someone she is not to fulfill the role that Torvald, her father, and the society have expected of her\n*   Nora’s **awakening** is complete with Tolvald's severe and selfish reaction after learning her deception and forgery; it is the final catalyst\n    *   Although this marks her awakening, she has been defying Torvald in small yet meaningful ways (eating macaroons then lying), which eventually led up to her making her own decision of leaving\n    *   As audience, we already know that she is capable of defying authorities in small ways (as she ate the macaroons)\n*   At the end of the play, there is a slight role reversal: at the start, Nora was expected to ask Torvald Helmer whether he could do anything\n    *   But at the end, we see Helmer begging her to stay as she leaves.\n*   For Nora, the main growth is her process of **self-discovery** as she transitions from a flighty girl in Act 1 to a sober figure seated at the table with Helmer in Act 3\n*   At the end, she finally understands that her husband has made her into an object to be played with and to be molded to their own liking: her personality has been largely constructed by others, and she has become an object to be played with or looked at, and she decides to shape a new herself\n*   Nora has emerged from a “silly” and weak girl to a feminist hero, more aware of her position in the household and in the society\n    *   She starts off by revealing her childish qualities, but as the play progresses, she proves that she is not just a silly, childish women; she is a strong, courageous, and valiant character, capable of adapting to change\n*   At the end when Torvald tells her that she must be a mother, she replies by saying that she is first and foremost a human being, hence she decided to make a decision that will benefit her she has been oppressed\n\n\n### Torvald Helmer\n\n\n\n*   Nora’s husband, who is happy with his new position at the bank, as he has authority\n*   He treats Nora **patronizingly** like a child and does not view her as an equal, but rather as a **doll** that he can play with and tease\n*   He is overly concerned with his place and **status** in the society, and he allows his emotions to be swayed heavily by the prospect of society’s respect and the fear of society’s scorn\n*   He believes that a man’s role in marriage is to protect and guide the wife, and clearly enjoys that Nora needs his guidance, and hence he interacts with her as if he is her father rather than an equal husband\n*   He **instructs** her by saying “A home that depends on loans and debt is not beautiful because it is not free”, almost sounding like he is trying to **force his opinions** on her, and he also teaches Nora the dance and likes to envision himself as Nora’s saviour: “do you know that I’ve often wished you were facing some terrible dangers so that I could risk life and limb, risk everything, for your sake?”\n*   Although he seizes power in the relationship and refers to Nora as a “girl”, it seems that Torvald is actually the weaker and more **childlike** character\n    *   This is clear with Dr. Rank’s explanation for not wanting Torvald to enter is sickroom: “Torvald is so fastidious, he can't face up to anything ugly”; Dr Rank fears Torvald must be **sheltered** like a child from the **realities** of the world\n    *   Furthermore, his decision to fire Krogstad stems ultimately from the fact that he feels threatened and offended by Krogstad’s failure to pay him proper respect.\n*   He is very conscious of other **people’s perceptions** of him and of standing up in the community; his explanation for rejecting Nora’s request that Krogstad be kept on at the office is that it would make him “a laughing stock before the entire staff\n    *   This demonstrates that he prioritizes his reputation over his wife’s desires\n    *   Additionally, he further indicates his deep **need for society’s respect** in his reaction to Nora’s deception: although he says that Nora has ruined his happiness and will not be allowed to raise the children, he insists that she remain in the house because of his concern in saving “**the appearance**” of their household.\n*   He enjoys **objectifying** his wife and showing off her beauty: he tells Dr Rank “worth seeing, if you ask me!”, and Nora tells Mrs Linde that Helmer wants to “keep me all to himself”\n*   He trusts her enough to leave her alone with Dr Rank, but after learning that he is going to die, he says “now that you and I have no one but each other”, suggesting that he is **indifferent** to Dr Rank leaving them.\n*   He enforces rules and seems to be a person of integrity, and he feels that he is entitled to judge Krogstad\n    *   He is a conformist as he **does not question** rules and the society – he is also absent from the debate about moral health and the community in Act 1 between Nora and Dr Rank \n*   He gives Nora no opportunity to explain herself\n    *   This is **ironic** because she is able to express her pain and discuss the complexity of the situation with Krogstad, the antagonist of the play, but not her own husband\n    *   This links to the differences in **communication**, which ultimately leads to the end of their marriage\n*   He takes the rules of the society for granted: he feels that he cannot be questioned since he is a husband and employer: he feels that he has authority as he controls Nora, down to eating the macaroons\n    *   He also believes he is an **idealist**, as he **stage-manages** Nora’s dance and lectures Kristine about knitting and embroidering, although he could have been drunk at the time\n*   He praises Nora for the tarantella dance, but then continues to take a condescending tone with her\n    *   He undermines her by saying, “**Do you think I was going to let her remain there after and spoil the affect?**”\n    *   It shows that he only cares about himself and his appearance, and that his wife must always follow and do what he says\n    *   He treats her as if she is his possession rather than another human being: this is brought out further by all of the names he calls her such as “capricious little Caprice maiden”, which shows that he does not think of her as an equal\n    *   He feels that he has a higher status and more importance in the family, while she is only there for his pleasure\n*   He never realizes that he is more interested in power than the rights and wrongs of a situation\n*   Although he imagines himself to stand for common sense, although he is quite dramatic himself: “Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake”, and hence conforms to the **stereotypical** image of a male hero\n*   However, this “**hero**” disintegrates when he says “**I’m saved**”, as he seems to disregard Nora completely\n    *   This follows as he says “I will protect you like a hunted dove that I have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating heart”, which come in direct contrast his **egoistic** attitude of saying “I’m saved!”\n*   Although Helmer is the least admirable character, and is clearly **self-centered**, he is not consciously selfish in his own gain at the expense of others\n    *   He is **blissfully unaware** of the harsh realities, such as the doctors keeping the illnesses from him\n\n\n### Krogstad\n\n\n\n*   A lawyer who used to work with Torvald, who is going to get fired by him\n*   His character is **contradictory**: although he wants to protect his children, he is willing to use unethical tactics to do so\n*   Although he causes sufference to Nora, he feels **sympathy** for her\n    *   This, in a way, differentiates him from Helmer\n    *   It is also **ironic** that the antagonist is able to feel sympathy, while Helmer himself only cares about himself\n*   He is the **antagonist** in the play, although he is **not necessarily the villain**. He tries to justify his behaviour by saying: “Even money-lenders, hacks, well, a man like me, can have a little of what you call feeling, you know.”\n    *   Ibsen has not created one-sided binary characters, but rather each character has a spectrum of emotions and empathies, making them more realistic\n    *   Hence the play is a modern play\n*   Through his willingness to allow Nora's torment to continue is cruel, he still has **sympathy** for her\n    *   He also visits her to check on her and discourage her from committing suicide.\n*   He has reasonable motives for behaving as he does: he wants to keep his job at the bank in order to spare his children from the hardships that come from a spoiled reputation\n    *   This separates him from Torvald: Torvald seems to desire respect from selfish reasons, while Krogstad desires it for his family’s sake\n*   His character is also similar to that of Nora’s: both have been wronged by society, and both of them have committed the same crime: forgery of signatures\n    *   Through he did break the law, Krogstad’s crime was minor, but the society still saw him as a criminal\n    *   He can also be seen as a **victim of circumstances** as he was abandoned by Mrs Linde for a man with more money\n    *   Therefore, it can be said that society forced Mrs Linde away from him and prompted his crime\n\n\n### Mrs Linde\n\n\n\n*   Nora’s childhood friend, she is a practical, down-to-earth women\n*   Her account of living in poverty highlights **Nora’s privileged nature**\n*   We learn that **she took responsibility** for her sick parents whereas Nora abandoned her father when he was ill\n*   Usually male expresses love, but Mrs Linde is a shipwreck, to make it more poignant, she says she is in the wreckage\n\n\n### Dr Rank\n\n\n\n*   Torvald’s best friend, he is one character who remains **unconcerned** about what others think of him\n*   He avoids talking to Torvald about his death out of respect for his distaste for ugliness and things that are not perfect\n*   He is the personification of Torald’s thoughts of “diseases” in the “household” that spread to the children\n*   He is the play’s detached observer, a common element of well-made plays\n*   He is in love with Nora, and has more than a desire for her\n\n\n### Nursemaid (Anne-Marie)\n\n\n\n*   The Helmer’s nursemaid, who has an **affection** for Nora as she had to give up her own child to take the nursing job\n*   She shares with Nora and Mrs Linde the act of sacrificing her own happiness out of economic necessity\n*   Nora’s concern at how cold she is suggests that she is more interested in the children's enjoyment than her own comfort\n*   It is the nurse who is **responsible** for the fact that Nora feels most comfortable with people who are not authoritative figures such as the servants or Dr Rank\n*   It is clear that Nora trusts her enough to bring up the children in her own absence when she leaves Helmer at the end, and this reduces the judgement she receives from the audience as the children are left in good hands\n    *   This, in a way, also redeems Nora’s character as we know that the children will be safe\n*   She is a character who has suffered the most through poverty and disgrace, and also betrayed by another man, so she had no choice but to give up her own children\n    *   Her suffering is in great contrast to the other characters as Krogstad still got to keep his children\n    *   Her character can be a role model for Nora, showing that it is possible to make a new life for yourself\n\n\n## Motifs\n\n\n### Nora’s definition of **freedom**\n\n\n\n*   Nora's understanding of freedom evolves over the course of the play\n*   In Act 1, she believes that she will be totally “free” when she has repaid the debt as she can then devote herself to her domestic responsibilities with ease\n*   However, after Krogstad blackmails her, she reconsiders and questions whether she is happy in Torvald’s house, where she is subjected to his orders\n*   By the end of the play, she seeks a new kind of freedom; she wants the be relieved of her familial obligations to pursue her own ambitions, beliefs, and identity\n\n\n### Letters and **paper**\n\n\n\n*   Majority of the plot twists involve the reading and writing of **letters**, which in the play represent the **unpleasant truth**, and situations obscured by Torvald and Nora’s beautification\n*   Krogstad writes two letters: one revealing Nora’s crime of forgery and the other retracting his blackmail threat\n    *   The **first letter** represents the truth about Nora’s past and initiates the inevitable dissolution of her marriage (she says “We are lost”)\n    *   Her attempts to stall Torvald from reading the letter represent her continue denial of the true nature of her marriage: at first even she does not realize that her marriage is an illusion\n    *   The **second letter** releases Nora from her obligation to Krogstad and represents her release from her obligation to Torvald\n    *   Upon reading it, Torvald attempts to return to his and Nora’s previous **denial of reality**, but Nora recognizes that the letter have exposed the truth about his selfishness, and hence she can no longer participate in the illusion of a happy marriage.\n*   Dr Rank’s method of communicating his imminent death is to leave his calling card marked with a black cross in Torvald’s letterbox\n*   This is because Torvald has an unwillingness to accept reality when he proclaims, “Torvald is so fastidious, he cannot act up to anything ugly”\n*   Mrs Linde also sends a note to Krogstad which initiates her life-changing meeting with him, and Torvald’s letter of dismissal to Krogstad\n*   The letter serves as a catalyst in the play, similar to in Wide Sargasso Sea, when Daniel writes a letter \n\n\n### Doors\n\n\n\n*   The door slamming is quite a **dramatic** moment for a play\n    *   It is quite shocking as it is a result of all the **tension** built up from the beginning of the play\n*   Usually dialog was used to show dramatic elements, but now an action and sound is used\n*   In the play, the doors usually show changes in mood\n*   Krogstad uses the back door when he comes in to be stealthy as he plans something nefarious, while Nora walks out confidentially out of the front door to show her agency\n*   Doors could represent the difference in what men and women had the ability to do in the patriarchal society\n    *   For example, Nora never left the house, she was almost trapped by Helmer as she does not have access to her own house\n    *   Furthermore, she is not permitted to enter Helmer’s study, and she has to use her ears to listen\n    *   The state of women is clearly brought out as Nora had to **rebel** in her own house.\n*   Doors are also metaphors of the marital relationship, similar to a barrier between Nora and Torvald and how they do not understand each other.\n*   Similar to Nora, the nursemaid also left her house because the husband couldn't not fulfill the duties of earning enough money, so she had to leave to earn money\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n### The christmas tree\n\n\n\n*   Symbolizes **Nora's position in her household** as a **plaything** which is pleasing to look at and adds charm to the house\n*   Nora instructs the maid that the children can't see the tree until it has been decorated, and she also tells Torvald that no one can see her in her dress until the evening of the dance\n*   At the beginning of the second act, Nora’s psychological condition has begun to erode, and the stage directions also show that the tree is “dishevelled”\n*   At the start of Act 2, it is described as “stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its dishevelled branches”: it is starting to contrast the usually contrasting connotations it carries\n    *   It currently suggests the continuation of Nora's confusion and belief in the illusion of Helmer accepting and forgiving her actions.\n    *   Therefore, the tree is a symbol to Nora’s psychological state\n\n\n### New Year's Day\t\n\n\n\n*   Both Nora and Torvald look forward to New Year’s as a start of a happier live: Torvald will start his new job and certifies extra money and respect the job will give him, and Nora also looks forward to his job as she will be able to repay her debt to Krogstad\n*   By the end of the play, however, the nature of the nre start of Newy Year changes dramatically for both of them: they both become new people and face radically changed ways of living\n*   Hence the new year comes to mark the beginning of a truly new and different period in both their lives and their personalities\n\n\n### Tarantella\n\n\n\n*   It was believed that when someone was bitten by one, the only way to get rid of the venom was to dance and sweat it out\n*   In the dance scene, Nora is dancing excitedly as she is worried about the consequences of her actions\n*   Her dancing can be seen as a way for her to get rid of as much poison as possible so that she does not affect her children\n*   It is not a regular dance, as she is very emotional\n*   Helmer, the man, is contollering her, and asking her to calm down, having no clue why she is hysterical\n    *   Her psychological state is also described as “distracted” from the impending … (find quote)\n\n\n### Doll\n\n\n\n*   At the exposition, Nora notes that dolls are quite cheap and easily breakable [[combined points](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.9x7rpt4yhono)]\n\n\n### Lamp (32)\n\n\n\n*   In Act 2, the lamp creates a dramatic moment as More symbolically exploits her new light with Dr Rank\n\n\n## Context\n\n\n\n1. Bourgeois\n    *   This means belonging to or characteristic of the **middle class**, typically with reference to its perceived materialistic values or conventional attitudes\n    *   Bourgeois could also be used to describe conventional people in the 1800s, when economies were growing rapidly leading to people with more wealth, and changing priorities\n    *   Krogstad and Torvald are the embodiment of the bourgeoisie while Nora is a victim\n    *   The bourgeoisie lifestyle is brought out through Torvald\n        *   He symbolizes the average man of that time period, and is described to money-minded, self-righteous, and selfish\n    *   He lives under the allusion of him having total control over his family members; this is evident as he treats Nora akin to a “doll”, and casually fires Krogstad for a petty reason\n    *   When Nora tells him about the forgery, he abandons his facade of love for her and gets angry, and when Krogstad threat’s disappear, he goes back to his former self, demonstrating his hypocritical nature\n    *   Nora was expected to behave hike a typical bourgeoisie women by Torvald, but instead, as the play progresses, she slowly starts to go against the norms of the society, and at the end of the play she openly defies them and separates herself from these values\n2. **Metamorphosis**\n    *   This is described as a change of the form of a thing or person to something completely different: the process of **transformation from an immature form to an adult**\n    *   At the end of the play, Nora metamorphoses as she is self-awakened\n        *   She undergoes this change when she realizes that Torvald does not have any real respect for her\n3. Women’s emancipation\n    *   This was the effort to secure equal rights for women at the remove any gender discrimination from laws and behavioural patterns\n    *   In the play, we see an **imbalance in power** through the was Nora is treated by Helmer\n    *   She is treated like his “pet” or “property”, and it is evident that Krogstad and Dr. Rank do not take her seriously either as she is a woman\n    *   Additionally, she speaks about the sense of “pride” she got from travelling to Italy as it makes her feel “almost like a man”\n    *   At the end she realizes that she is not being treated like an equal and hence decides to leave\n4. Feminism\n    *   It is the belief that both men and women should be provided equal rights and opportunities\n    *   _A Doll’s House_ starts with a stereotypical portrayal of women as financially dependent one men, incapable of making decisions or taking care of themselves\n    *   The way Helmer treats his wife is demeaning and makes Nora seem like a “doll” to be played with and controlled\n    *   However, as the play progresses, we she that she is bright enough to make her own decisions for herself: this ranges from her small lies to the secrecy about both borrowing and forging\n        *   She is clever as she is able to manipulate her way around.\n        *   We then see her transform into a responsible individual; this is emphasized by the act of her leaving everything she was previously dependent one and looking out for herself\n    *   The play being set in 1879 was described as “**a play phenomenally ahead of its time**”\n        *   At first, the gender stereotypes were being conformed to around the world and patriarchal societies were the norm\n        *   Since then, women have been fighting for equality, and the feminist movement started.\n5. Social facades and hypocrisy\n    *   A **facade** refers to a false appearance or way of behaving that hides what someone or something really is\n        *   This is prevalent in society as people tend to portray themselves in a way different from their true nature in order to fit in with societal norms\n    *   **Hypocrisy** is the practise of claiming to have higher standards or more noble beliefs that is the case\n    *   Nora was putting up a submissive and helpless **facade** in front of her husband and the rest of the society to fit in with societal expectations from a woman, when in reality she does have the strength and wit (as we see through the way she handles the situation)\n    *   This theme is also brought out by Helmer towards the end of the play as he is more concerned about his appearance in society than his wife\n6. Idealist\n    *   An idealist is someone who believes that very good things can be achieved, often when it seems unlikely to others\n    *   _A Doll’s House_ deals with aesthetic idealism\n    *   Helmer is the personification of the idealis: noble, high morals, refined taste\n        *   Appearances and aesthetics to him are key, as laid out through the opening\n    *   His home is carefully decorated: carpeted floors, engravings, and a piano, an expensive item\n    *   The ideal he sees in Nora is nothing but a reflection of himself: he is infatuated by her beauty and wants to control her\n    *   Nora is the ideal wife catering to his ideal tastes, and behind this fantasy lies a desire for authority in Helmer\n7. Patriarchy\n    *   It is a social or governmental system in which males hold primary power and dominant roles while women are largely excluded from it. These roles include political leadership, moral authority, social privilege, and control of property\n    *   Patriarchal is demonstrated through Helmer as a typical male in the society: he makes all the decisions and controls Nora’s allowance\n    *   He treats Nora like a child, and also attempts to control her smallest actions, such as eating macaroons\n        *   This reinforces that she has unknowingly taken the role as a “doll”, a toy\n    *   Despite Nora's capabilities, she is forbidden from taking charge and making decisions in her own way; she is forced to follow his will, which in turn leaves her suppressed\n8. Social class and hierarchy\n    *   Class refers to societal division based on economic and social status while hierarchy refers to people being grouped into different social categories (upper, middle, lower)\n    *   The play takes place in a Norwegian town in 1979 where there were separated classes in the society, and men were expected to be the head of the family, while women were expected to work at home, without any true power\n    *   The play occurred after a time of economic progress, so that middle class was recently made more wealthy\n    *   This is made clear with the house which is “comfortably and tastefully furnished”, and the fact that they have servants\n    *   Additionally, Nora's behaviour with Krogstad supports this: she feels superior to him as he is a member of the lower class\n    *   Furthermore, when Nora and Mrs Linde talk about their husbands, Mrs Linde says that she “didn't think it would be right for [her] to refuse him”. This reiterates the fact that women would get married to improve their status in the society.\n    *   There is also a prominent difference between men and women of the same societal class. Nora, a woman, was only expected to have knowledge on domestic affairs\n        *   For this reason, she did not tell Torvald that she borrowed money to save his life as it would be “painful and humiliating … with his manly self respect, to know that he owed anything to me.”\n    *   This concept is still important today because in many countries there is still a strong divide between the lower, working, and upper class. Women’s rights have increased in recent years.\n9. Reception\n    *   The play gave rise to debate and controversy, and people fixated one the fact that Nora left her family and responsibilities being because at that time, the greatest responsibility of a woman was not to herself but to her family\n    *   For this reason, Ibsen was forced to write an alternate ending for the German theaters as it was unacceptable. Ibsen called the alternative ending “barbaric”, and a “disgrace” to the play. This incident indicated how strong the ideologies of that time were, and how event Ibsen, a man standing against those ideologies, was forced to give in at a certain point.\n    *   Presently readers understand Nora’s decisions, but readers are often appalled at the restrictions placed on women in these times\n\n\n### Genre: realism\n\n\n\n*   Ibsen was a realist playwright as he wrote this play on actual problems in a typical household at the time. He shows an iconoclast in the society\n*   The setting also makes it realistic: it is a middle-class bourgeoisie house, and all the action takes place there, hence the audience can easily relate to the issues demonstrated\n*   There are also very common props with dramatic effects (such as the Christmas tree showing Nora’s mental state)\n\n\n# Themes\n\n\n## Sacrificial role of women\n\n\n\n*   There are many instances of sacrificial in the play: Mrs Linde abandoned Krogstad to marry a richer man, the nursemaid abandoned her own children to support herself, and Nora left her children to get a better life for herself\n*   Although Nora was economically advantaged compared to the other females, she nevertheless lead a difficult life because socially dictated that Torvald be the marriage’s dominant partner\n    *   Torvald condescends Nora, and she had to hide her loan from him because she knows that he could never accept that he is debt to his wife\n    *   She also had to work in secret to pay back the loan\n    *   In the end, this makes her vulnerable to Krogstad’s blackmail because she has no one to go to for help but herself.\n*   The nursemaid’s story serves as a foreshadowing tool as Nora also ends up leaving her husband and children with her\n    *   This, in a way, makes the audience judge her less as we know that their children are left under good hands\n\n\n## Parental and filial obligations\n\n\n\n*   Nora, Torvald, and Dr Rank each express the belief that a parent is obligated to be honest and upstanding, because a parent’s immorality is passed on to their children like a disease: “A fog of lies like that in a household, and it spreads disease and infection to every past of it. Every breath the children take in that kind of house is reeking evil germs”\n*   In fact, Dr Rank does have a disease which is a direct result of his father's depravity, and he also implies that his father’s immorality (affairs with women) led him to contract a disease that he passed on to his son, leading him to suffer for his father’s misdeeds [find quote]\n*   Torvald also strongly believes that one's parents determine one’s moral character with the line: “Nearly all young criminals had lying mothers”, and he also refuses to allow Nora to interact with their children after he learns of her deceit, for fear that she will corrupt them.\n\n\n## Unreliability of appearances\t\n\n\n\n*   In the play, appearances are often misleading and mask the reality of the characters and their situations: our first impressions of Nora, Torvald, and Krogstad are eventually undercut. Nora first seems like a childish silly women, but as the play goes on, we see her intelligent, motivated, and by the play’s conclusion, a strong-willed independent thinker\n    *   Torvald, though he plays the part of a strong benevolent husband, reveals himself to be **cowardly, petty, and selfish** and he fears Krogstad may expose him to scandal\n    *   Krogstad reveals himself to be much more **sympathetic and merciful** than what he first appears to be.\n*   The play’s climax is a matter of resolving identity confusion:\n    *   Krogstad as a sympathetic and merciful lover\n    *   Nora as an intelligent, independent woman who can make her own decisions, and one who has agency\n    *   Torvald as someone who only cares about themselves, and one who never cared about his wife\n*   Situations are not only misinterpreted by the audience, but also by the characters\n    *   The hatred between Mrs Linde and Krogstad turns out to be love\n    *   Nora’s creditor turns out to be Krogstad, and not Dr Rank, as we see Mrs Linde suppose\n    *   Dr Rank confesses that he is in love with Nora\n    *   The seemingly villainous Krogstad repents and returns Nora’s contract to her, while the seemingly kindhearted Mrs Linde ceases to help Nora and forces Torvald’s discovery of Nora’s secret.\n*   The appearances within the Helmer Household results from Torvald’s devotion to an image at the expense of the creation of true happiness\n    *   Because he craves respect, image is very important to him, and hence he gets angry when disrespected: when Nora calls him petty and when Krogstad address him by his first name\n*   By the end of the play, it is clear that while controlling his home’s appearance and his separated suppression and denial of reality have harmed his family and his happiness irreparably\n\n\n## Love and marriage\n\n\n\n*   The entire play is seen as an exploration of love\n\n\n## Individual and society\n\n\n\n*   A doll is a thing whose character is determined by the owner according to the functions it is expected to serve. It does not play any major role and is never removed from the home\n    *   In Act 3, Nora says “I believe that before all else I am a reasonable human being”, and is also claiming the right to her**self**.\n*   Similar to a doll, in the first two acts, she never leaves the house (she doesn't leave without Helmer), and she is restricted as she cannot enter his study (point expanded on above)\n    *   However, in Act 3, she finally leaves the house on her own decision and decides to make a life for herself\n*   At the beginning of the play, her identity is determined by others: for Helmer, she is a sexual partner, a mother, and a housekeeper\n*   She forges a signature, she assumes that assumes that it will have no effect on who she is. To her, interaction with the outer world is like “being a man”\n    *   This shows that at the start of the play, Nora is a stereotypical women who agrees and does not question the societal gender roles\n*   After Krostead takes back the blackmail, Helmer feels that he can grant Nora the roles of a mother and wife again without issues, but this is when Nora doesn't agree and decides to leave the home: Nora no longer accepts him as the authority in the relationship (she cannot allow him to redefine motherhood), so she leaves to learn more about herself\n\n\n## Disease and inheritance\n\n\n\n*   When Nora asks for money, Helmer replies: “It is in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora”\n    *   However, later we learn that Nora is only pretending to share her father’s extravagance as the money is going to pay off her debt to Krogstad\n    *   Her father was likely knowling in fraud and corruption, but her crime is due to her ignorance.\n*   Similarly, Dr Rank also has a biological illness that he inherited, and he didn't marry so that the illness could die with him\n*   Both Helmer and Dr Rank use the **metaphor** of corrupt behaviour as moral sickness\n    *   For Helmer, this sickness invariably spreads, and its source is at home, and can also infect the children with the “germs of evil”.\n*   The play is full of graphic images of death: Rank describes his own body: “rotting in the churchyard”, and Nora seems to intend to die in the “icy, black water”\n    *   However, Krogstad and Nora understand that suicide is not a noble sacrifice\n\n\n## Money\n\n\n\n*   Nora borrows money to do something useful, but the money is not represented in actual money, but rather as a piece of paper (link to the motif of paper), which is an evidence of the crime she committed \n*   Her criminal act has brought her into a new world which is **male-dominated**: she proclaims her place in a world of “quarterly interest” and “installments”\n*   Helmer is quick to condemn Nora; although his job at the bank involves borrowing and lending money, he does not want a debt\n    *   This brings out the irony and the hypocrisy\n\n\n## Home\n\n\n\n*   Nora’s once home in Act 1 becomes a prison in which she feels she has been trapped and restricted [find quote] in Act 3, so she decided to leave\n*   Nora is called skylark, squirrel, songbird, all of which are wild creatures\n    *   This can be linked to the fact that the house is a cage for Nora, and it is also shown as she is not even given access to her own house (see above)\n\n\n# Language and style\n\n\n\n*   Helmer always refers to Nora by a nickname or patronizing adjective such as “little”, followed by “lark”, “songbird”, “squirrel”, and he often uses the possessive pronoun “my”\n*   Nora has many soliloquies throughout the play\n    *   For example, at the end of Act 2, Nora says to herself: “Five o'clock. Seven hours until midnight; and then four-and-twenty hours until the next midnight. Then the Tarantella will be over. Twenty-four and seven? Thirty-one hours to live.”\n    *   The bird names also depict the weakness of Nora\n        *   Torvald saw this as a way to control her, by making her weaker than she already is\n\n\n# Structure\n\n\n\n*   The play follows the structure of a **well-made play**: the exposition sets up the situation through the conversations, and the audience are informed with everything they know to understand what has already happened\n*   We are also aware that the situation is pressing as Nora is in crisis, and Act 1 ends on a note of high suspense and drama with Krogstad's demand\n*   In Act 2, we see Nora struggle to find a way out of the situation: first she tries to change Helmer’s mind, then she tries to act Dr. Rank for help, then when all the solutions change, Krogstad changes the demands by making them more serious\n*   Nora’s dissertation, using her tarantella to postpone the inevitable creates a high dramatic impact\n*   In Act 3, the suspense is developed further by Ibsen creating possible resolution of the letter being destroyed. More suspense is also created as Dr Rank delays Helmer’s reading of the letter\n*   The play ends with the dramatic confrontation of Nora and Helmer. Nora’s leaving at that time allows the play to end dramatically\n    *   Had she taken time to decide, all the dramatic impact would have been lost\n    *   Furthermore, she also left at that moment to ensure that the play has unity of time\n*   The play ends in Christmas with “greatest miracle of all”, which is a possible redemption for Torvald as he seems to have understood the role of Nora in his live as a lover\n\n\n# Quotes\n\n\n## Act 1\n\n\n\n1. ‘A Room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not **extravagantly**’\n    *   Provides evidence to the lifestyle and setting of the typical family of the hardworking and successful middle class\n    *   Realistic setting, reflecting the typical upper middle class household at the time\n    *   Creates a universal appeal as well\n2. Nora: “We have not needed to economize”; “… earn **lots and lots** of money”\n    *   Repetition shows pride of middle class in money earned\n    *   Elite part of the society\n    *   It also shows that she is naïve in terms of money, but we later see that she has been saving for quite a while\n        *   She is quite excited as she is almost done paying off her debt\n3. Nora: “I even hinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry”\n    *   Strict and conservative views of Torvald who represents the majority of the working middle class at the time\n    *   Shows that Nora is not the naïve women Torvald sees her to be\n4. Nora: “So you are quite alone. How dreadfully sad”\n    *   Shows how according to Nora, Christine’s entire life revolves around her husband and children, and that she cannot imagine her life being separated from them\n        *   Even though she wanted her agency, she was a stereotypical woman who was confirming to the stereotypes until she decided to leave and make a life of her own\n    *   Christine is pitied\n\n\n## Act 2\n\n\n\n1. When a poor girl’s been in trouble she must take the best of things: the nursemaid\n2. Nora (31): “Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learnt at Capri.\n    *   She is dressing up exactly how Helmer wants her\n3. Kristine (31): “I see; you are going to keep up the character”\t\n    *   This brings in some irony, as she says that she will “keep up the character”, as if she knows that the marriage is just an illusion\n4. Kristine (31): “But, my deases Nora, how do you know anything about such things”\n    *   Similar to Helmer, Kristine also treats Nora like a child and does not think she is intelligent\n5. Nora: “Torvald is so absurfly fond of me that he wants me absolutely to himself”\n    *   She mistakes his attitudes as love and romance\n    *   She is lost in her utopian illusions\n6. Nora: “Torvald can't bear to see dressmaking going on”\n    *   Only wants to see perfection: the house is meant to be kept as he pleases\n    *   The dressmaking is messy work, which Torvald can’t bear to see, similar to why Dr. Rank doesn't want Helmer to see his dead body\n7. Nora (34): “If your little squirrel were to ask you for something very, very prettily–”\n    *   Shows that men have dominance in the household, and they make all the important decisions\n    *   Women were dependent on men for everything, including getting money/allowance: they are financially dependent on men\n    *   Therefore, Nora must seduce and manipulate her husband in order to get him to do something she needs or wants\n8. Helmer (35): “Is it to get about now that the new manager has changed his mind at his wife’s bidding”\n    *   He thinks he will be judged if his wife, a woman, were able to change his mind\n    *   His appearance is very important to him and he wants to show that he is independent\n9. Helmer (35): “if only this obstinate little person can get her way!”\n    *   He doesn't treat Nora as an equal individual, rather he treats her like a child\n    *   His views are clearly more important to him\n10. Rank (38): “You are a greater rascal than I thought”\n   *   Not only does Torvald treating Nora like a child, but even Dr Rank does\n   *   This shows that men had a higher position on the society\n   *   Women were supposed to be submissive towards the men\n11. Rank (40): “Nora––do you think he is the only one––?”\n    *   Dr Rank expressed his love for Nora\n    *   This is what causes Nora not to ask him for the money\n12. Krogstad (43): “It would not be the least like our dear Torvald Helmer to show so much courage”\t\n    *   He mocks Torvald offstage\n13. Krogstad (44): “Or even something worse–– …… Give up the idea”\n    *   Krogstad knows that Nora will likely commit suicide, so he tries to persuade her not to\n    *   He has been the same situation before, so he knows how she will think\n    *   Although he is the villain, he cares about Nora, more than Torvald himself does\n14. Krogstad (44): “For the last year and a half I have not had a hand in anything dishonorable”\n    *   We, as audience, learn that Krogstad is an honest man, and also a victim of circumstances\n    *   Helmer’s reasons for wanting to fire him are mostly personal as he is not respected by him; Helmer is likely being quite unreasonable\n15. Krogstad (45): “Oh, you can’t frighten me. A fine, spoilt lady like you––”\n\n\n## Act 3\n\n\n\n1. Krogstad: “I am a shipwrecked man clinging to a bit of wreckage”\n    *   Contrasts the relation between Helmer and Nora\n    *   There is mutual respect and reciprocation in the relation of Krogstad and Christine\n2. Christine: “Nils, give me someone and something to work for”\n    *   In this relation, Christine proposes to Krogstad, and is hence classified as an iconoclast\n    *   This differentiates their relationship, there is mutual respect and reciprocation\n3. Helmer: “Why shouldn't I look at my dearest treasure?--at all the beauty that is mine, all my very own?”\n    *   Possessive and controlling, objectifies by calling her his treasure\n    *   He talks to her as if he owns her\n\n\n# Notes\n\n\n## Unities\n\n\n\n*   Time: it makes it dramatic that she leaves the house right at that time\n    *   If she waited to think, the dramatic impact that was built up in their conversation would be lost\n    *   The play ends with a high dramatic impact.\n*   Place: the play takes place in a single place\n*   Action: there is mainly one plot\n    *   Although there is a subplot, it reinforces the main plot (The misunderstandings and dysfunctional marriage of Nora and Helmer)\n\n\n### SImilarities in the crimes of Krogstad and Nora\n\n\n\n*   Krogstad was disrupted as he forged a signature for greed and personal/family advancement\n    *   He underwent unethical means to advance his family and himself\n*   Nora also forged a signature to save mostly her family\n*   In the end, both paid a price\n*   Both have been marginalized by society or their family\n    *   Krogstad was marginalized professionally and socially\n    *   Nora on accounts of her gender\n*   Both are “poisoning” their children with crime\n    *   Torvald blames Nora for her bad “genes”\n*   The idea of **inherited madness** is also seen in Wide Sargasso Sea, and is used against characters\n\n\n## Dr Rank’s interactions with Nora \n\n\n\n*   Early on in the play, we learn that Dr Rank and Nora are good friends, and he is considered an equal to Helmer\n*   Helmer also trusts Dr Rank to be left alone with Nora\n*   In Act 2, when Nora tries to borrow the money from Dr Rank, we see Nora have an adult conversation with someone for the first time\n    *   Helmer and Kristine both treated her like a child, like someone who is protected from the harsh realities of life, although we as audience know that she is not \n    *   Her interaction with Dr Rank goes against her constant infantilizing\n*   Dr Rank and Nora’s interaction create a **subtext**, which is when unspoken ideas and emotions are shown\n    *   Both Nora and Dr Rank speak in code, making it clear that Nora understands his situation\n    *   Dr Rank develops on Helmer’s point about hereditary, and his comparison to Nora’s father\n\n\n## Nora’s departure and ending\n\n\n\n*   The protagonist took a crucial decision to leave her family after understanding that she had lived in illusion for the past years: she wanted to face reality.\n*   She was blinded from the truth by comfort; she was trapped in domestic comfort and gets everything she wants, while losing touch with the outside world and consequently realizing the truth\n*   She first realizes that she is not truly loved when she is prevented from eating what she loved\n*   She was expecting a miracle in which her husband would save her from the danger, but instead when she witnessed the complete opposite, and hence she revolted and left him\n    *   She has always obeyed his wished and expected him to save her\n    *   It came as a shock to her that he only cared about himself..\n*   She also found out that she had no identity, as it was completely shaped by her father and husband. She was deprived of speech and action, and hence decided to leave Torvald. When the forgery was revealed, she was made aware that her relationship with her husband was not mutual. She also found an imbalance in power distribution between her husband and her as Torvald was the dominant one. She made nothing out of her life as she had been living under the shadow of other men (Torvald and her father: she says she has “been greatly wronged, Torvald––first by papa and then by you”). She decides to leave the Helmer household and experience the world for herself\n*   Essentially, she wants to discover who she really is, she wants to educate herself\n    *   She is willing to break her marriage in doing so, demonstrating that she has agency.\n*   Nora’s independent nature is in direct contrast with the tyrannical authority of Torvald\n    *   They both are not truthful to each other\n    *   When Torvald is proved to be disloyal and ungrateful, she leaves in order to find a better life for herself\n*   Through the course of the play, Nora grows, and reveals all the flaws in her relationship with Torvald; she exposes him\n*   Her development and transformation as a women leads to her emancipation\n*   **However**, she is going back to her father’s place to inherit all of his wealth, so she really isn't doing anything other than leaving him\n    *   She is still going to be protected with her father’s house and saving, so it is questionable whether she is going to make a life for herself\n\n\n## Self-awakening\n\n\n\n*   Nora's illusions about her family life are shattered by Helmer’s selfish and insensitive reaction to the news of Nora’s forgery: “What a horrible awakening! All these eight years--she who was my joy and pride--a hypocrite, a liar--worse, worse--a criminal!”\n    *   Helmer’s outburst grows her self-awakening, and Nora is finally able to see the truth in Helmer's character\n\n\n## Communication\n\n\n\n*   The play begins with superficial communications and dialogs: Torvald calls Nora his “little lark” and a “featherhead”\n    *   Nora exhibits a sense of false childishness in her actions such as “turning around quickly” and getting excited at the mention of money; she is also “playing with his coat buttons”\n    *   Torvald also seems to be close to Nora (false sense of closeness) with actions such as “taking her playfully by the ear” and “wagging his finger at her”\n*   These are all non-verbal communications, but they do not give a correct idea of their relationship\n*   Later, we see Nora speaking to other characters such as Kristine and Krogstad more seriously\n    *   She divulges her secrets to Mrs Linde\n    *   She appears more **familiar** and **relaxed** with Dr Rank\n    *   She says “Well, I’m damned” in front of them, something she would never say in front of Torvald\n    *   This reinforces the difference in her relationship with Torvald and Dr Rank/Kristine\n*   Her conversation with Krogstad is also quite different\n    *   She is calm, composed, and quite serious, showing her ability to achieve a **serious conversation**\n    *   She also shows **confidence** as she says that “one has a tiny little bit of influence”\n    *   She does not speak seriously in front to Torvald, apart from the end of the play\n*   The lack of communication led to the ending of the relationship\n    *   Torvald was unable to understand Nora due to their poor communication",html:"<h1>Forward</h1>\n<h2>Henrik Ibsen (author)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>After marrying and having children, he felt that rather than merely living together, the husband and wife should live as equals, free to become their own human beings</li>\n<li>However, critics attacked him for failing to respect the institution of marriage</li>\n<li>His writing created sensitive social issues and the Norwegian society frowned upon his work at first</li>\n<li>Father of Modern theater, he set out to develop serious ideas in a dramatic form</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Context</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Set in Victorian Norway in 1879</li>\n<li>The protagonist is very much like a real life character, as we see her slowly transform into a new character (metamorphosis)</li>\n<li>By the end of the play, she is a woman fighting for her opinions and against her conventional husband: this makes her a complex character</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Elements</h1>\n<h2>Characters</h2>\n<h3>Nora Helmer</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The protagonist of the play, she initially seems like a playful <strong>naïve</strong> child who lacks knowledge from the outside world, although we see later that she has experience of the outer world</li>\n<li>Her first word is “Hide”\n<ul>\n<li>This gives the audience an idea of her personality in nature of being secretive</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>act of rebellion</strong> with the macaroons indicates that she is <strong>not</strong> as innocent as she appears\n<ul>\n<li>The simple lie about eating the macaroons shows that she will lie when she needs to in order to escape certain situations</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She has a great <strong>zest</strong> (enthusiasm and energy): she takes pleasure in the Christmas tree, the taste of macaroons, and champagne\n<ul>\n<li>She is physically <strong>expressive and at ease</strong>, frequently kissing Helmer and playing affectionately with her children</li>\n<li>Her instinct is to reach out to people, and we do see her reach out to the nurse, Mrs Linde, and Dr Rank</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When we see her tarantella performance, we see she is a natural performer, turning to dance as a means of <strong>expressing what she cannot say</strong> (because societal constructs prevent her), and this draws awareness that she is <strong>‘performing’</strong> the role of wife which society has scripted for her\n<ul>\n<li>Later in the play, she starts to feel a resentment that she has to perform in order to ask Helmer for anything, and she realizes that she is not in an <strong>equal marriage</strong></li>\n<li>Later in the play, she is able to see her position in the marriage with an increasing clarity and finds the <strong>strength</strong> and <strong>agency</strong> to free herself from the oppressive position</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>At the start of the play, she responds affectionaley to Torvald’s teasing and is excited about the extra money she will get;

his explanation for rejecting Nora’s request that Krogstad be kept on at the office is that it would make him “a laughing stock before the entire staff\n<ul>\n<li>This demonstrates that he prioritizes his reputation over his wife’s desires</li>\n<li>Additionally, he further indicates his deep <strong>need for society’s respect</strong> in his reaction to Nora’s deception: although he says that Nora has ruined his happiness and will not be allowed to raise the children, he insists that she remain in the house because of his concern in saving “<strong>the appearance</strong>” of their household.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He enjoys <strong>objectifying</strong> his wife and showing off her beauty: he tells Dr Rank “worth seeing, if you ask me!”, and Nora tells Mrs Linde that Helmer wants to “keep me all to himself”</li>\n<li>He trusts her enough to leave her alone with Dr Rank, but after learning that he is going to die, he says “now that you and I have no one but each other”, suggesting that he is <strong>indifferent</strong> to Dr Rank leaving them.</li>\n<li>He enforces rules and seems to be a person of integrity, and he feels that he is entitled to judge Krogstad\n<ul>\n<li>He is a conformist as he <strong>does not question</strong> rules and the society – he is also absent from the debate about moral health and the community in Act 1 between Nora and Dr Rank</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He gives Nora no opportunity to explain herself\n<ul>\n<li>This is <strong>ironic</strong> because she is able to express her pain and discuss the complexity of the situation with Krogstad, the antagonist of the play, but not her own husband</li>\n<li>This links to the differences in <strong>communication</strong>, which ultimately leads to the end of their marriage</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He takes the rules of the society for granted: he feels that he cannot be questioned since he is a husband and employer: he feels that he has authority as he controls Nora, down to eating the macaroons\n<ul>\n<li>He also believes he is an <strong>idealist</strong>, as he <strong>stage-manages</strong> Nora’s dance and lectures Kristine about knitting and embroidering, although he could have been drunk at the time</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He praises Nora for the tarantella dance, but then continues to take a condescending tone with her\n<ul>\n<li>He undermines her by saying, “<strong>Do you think I was going to let her remain there after and spoil the affect?</strong>”</li>\n<li>It shows that he only cares about himself and his appearance, and that his wife must always follow and do what he says</li>\n<li>He treats her as if she is his possession rather than another human being: this is brought out further by all of the names he calls her such as “capricious little Caprice maiden”, which shows that he does not think of her as an equal</li>\n<li>He feels that he has a higher status and more importance in the family, while she is only there for his pleasure</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He never realizes that he is more interested in power than the rights and wrongs of a situation</li>\n<li>Although he imagines himself to stand for common sense, although he is quite dramatic himself: “Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake”, and hence conforms to the <strong>stereotypical</strong> image of a male hero</li>\n<li>However, this “<strong>hero</strong>” disintegrates when he says “<strong>I’m saved</strong>”, as he seems to disregard Nora completely\n<ul>\n<li>This follows as he says “I will protect you like a hunted dove that I have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating heart”, which come in direct contrast his <strong>egoistic</strong> attitude of saying “I’m saved!”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Although Helmer is the least admirable character, and is clearly <strong>self-centered</strong>, he is not consciously selfish in his own gain at the expense of others\n<ul>\n<li>He is <strong>blissfully unaware</strong> of the harsh realities, such as the doctors keeping the illnesses from him</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Krogstad</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A lawyer who used to work with Torvald, who is going to get fired by him</li>\n<li>His character is <strong>contradictory</strong>: although he wants to protect his children, he is willing to use unethical tactics to do so</li>\n<li>Although he causes sufference to Nora, he feels <strong>sympathy</strong> for her\n<ul>\n<li>This, in a way, differentiates him from Helmer</li>\n<li>It is also <strong>ironic</strong> that the antagonist is able to feel sympathy, while Helmer himself only cares about himself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He is the <strong>antagonist</strong> in the play, although he is <strong>not necessarily the villain</strong>. He tries to justify his behaviour by saying: “Even money-lenders, hacks, well, a man like me, can have a little of what you call feeling, you know.”\n<ul>\n<li>Ibsen has not created one-sided binary characters, but rather each character has a spectrum of emotions and empathies, making them more realistic</li>\n<li>Hence the play is a modern play</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Through his willingness to allow Nora's torment to continue is cruel, he still has <strong>sympathy</strong> for her\n<ul>\n<li>He also visits her to check on her and discourage her from committing suicide.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He has reasonable motives for behaving as he does: he wants to keep his job at the bank in order to spare his children from the hardships that come from a spoiled reputation\n<ul>\n<li>This separates him from Torvald: Torvald seems to desire respect from selfish reasons, while Krogstad desires it for his family’s sake</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>His character is also similar to that of Nora’s: both have been wronged by society, and both of them have committed the same crime: forgery of signatures\n<ul>\n<li>Through he did break the law, Krogstad’s crime was minor, but the society still saw him as a criminal</li>\n<li>He can also be seen as a <strong>victim of circumstances</strong> as he was abandoned by Mrs Linde for a man with more money</li>\n<li>Therefore, it can be said that society forced Mrs Linde away from him and prompted his crime</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mrs Linde</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora’s childhood friend, she is a practical, down-to-earth women</li>\n<li>Her account of living in poverty highlights <strong>Nora’s privileged nature</strong></li>\n<li>We learn that <strong>she took responsibility</strong> for her sick parents whereas Nora abandoned her father when he was ill</li>\n<li>Usually male expresses love, but Mrs Linde is a shipwreck, to make it more poignant, she says she is in the wreckage</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dr Rank</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Torvald’s best friend, he is one character who remains <strong>unconcerned</strong> about what others think of him</li>\n<li>He avoids talking to Torvald about his death out of respect for his distaste for ugliness and things that are not perfect</li>\n<li>He is the personification of Torald’s thoughts of “diseases” in the “household” that spread to the children</li>\n<li>He is the play’s detached observer, a common element of well-made plays</li>\n<li>He is in love with Nora, and has more than a desire for her</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Nursemaid (Anne-Marie)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Helmer’s nursemaid, who has an <strong>affection</strong> for Nora as she had to give up her own child to take the nursing job</li>\n<li>She shares with Nora and Mrs Linde the act of sacrificing her own happiness out of economic necessity</li>\n<li>Nora’s concern at how cold she is suggests that she is more interested in the children's enjoyment than her own comfort</li>\n<li>It is the nurse who is <strong>responsible</strong> for the fact that Nora feels most comfortable with people who are not authoritative figures such as the servants or Dr Rank</li>\n<li>It is clear that Nora trusts her enough to bring up the children in her own absence when she leaves Helmer at the end, and this reduces the judgement she receives from the audience as the children are left in good hands\n<ul>\n<li>This, in a way, also redeems Nora’s character as we know that the children will be safe</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She is a character who has suffered the most through poverty and disgrace, and also betrayed by another man, so she had no choice but to give up her own children\n<ul>\n<li>Her suffering is in great contrast to the other characters as Krogstad still got to keep his children</li>\n<li>Her character can be a role model for Nora, showing that it is possible to make a new life for yourself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Motifs</h2>\n<h3>Nora’s definition of <strong>freedom</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora's understanding of freedom evolves over the course of the play</li>\n<li>In Act 1, she believes that she will be totally “free” when she has repaid the debt as she can then devote herself to her domestic responsibilities with ease</li>\n<li>However, after Krogstad blackmails her, she reconsiders and questions whether she is happy in Torvald’s house, where she is subjected to his orders</li>\n<li>By the end of the play, she seeks a new kind of freedom; she wants the be relieved of her familial obligations to pursue her own ambitions, beliefs, and identity</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Letters and <strong>paper</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Majority of the plot twists involve the reading and writing of <strong>letters</strong>, which in the play represent the <strong>unpleasant truth</strong>, and situations obscured by Torvald and Nora’s beautification</li>\n<li>Krogstad writes two letters: one revealing Nora’s crime of forgery and the other retracting his blackmail threat\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>first letter</strong> represents the truth about Nora’s past and initiates the inevitable dissolution of her marriage (she says “We are lost”)</li>\n<li>Her attempts to stall Torvald from reading the letter represent her continue denial of the true nature of her marriage: at first even she does not realize that her marriage is an illusion</li>\n<li>The <strong>second letter</strong> releases Nora from her obligation to Krogstad and represents her release from her obligation to Torvald</li>\n<li>Upon reading it, Torvald attempts to return to his and Nora’s previous <strong>denial of reality</strong>, but Nora recognizes that the letter have exposed the truth about his selfishness, and hence she can no longer participate in the illusion of a happy marriage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Dr Rank’s method of communicating his imminent death is to leave his calling card marked with a black cross in Torvald’s letterbox</li>\n<li>This is because Torvald has an unwillingness to accept reality when he proclaims, “Torvald is so fastidious, he cannot act up to anything ugly”</li>\n<li>Mrs Linde also sends a note to Krogstad which initiates her life-changing meeting with him, and Torvald’s letter of dismissal to Krogstad</li>\n<li>The letter serves as a catalyst in the play, similar to in Wide Sargasso Sea, when Daniel writes a letter</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Doors</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The door slamming is quite a <strong>dramatic</strong> moment for a play\n<ul>\n<li>It is quite shocking as it is a result of all the <strong>tension</strong> built up from the beginning of the play</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Usually dialog was used to show dramatic elements, but now an action and sound is used</li>\n<li>In the play, the doors usually show changes in mood</li>\n<li>Krogstad uses the back door when he comes in to be stealthy as he plans something nefarious, while Nora walks out confidentially out of the front door to show her agency</li>\n<li>Doors could represent the difference in what men and women had the ability to do in the patriarchal society\n<ul>\n<li>For example, Nora never left the house, she was almost trapped by Helmer as she does not have access to her own house</li>\n<li>Furthermore, she is not permitted to enter Helmer’s study, and she has to use her ears to listen</li>\n<li>The state of women is clearly brought out as Nora had to <strong>rebel</strong> in her own house.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Doors are also metaphors of the marital relationship, similar to a barrier between Nora and Torvald and how they do not understand each other.</li>\n<li>Similar to Nora, the nursemaid also left her house because the husband couldn't not fulfill the duties of earning enough money, so she had to leave to earn money</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<h3>The christmas tree</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Symbolizes <strong>Nora's position in her household</strong> as a <strong>plaything</strong> which is pleasing to look at and adds charm to the house</li>\n<li>Nora instructs the maid that the children can't see the tree until it has been decorated, and she also tells Torvald that no one can see her in her dress until the evening of the dance</li>\n<li>At the beginning of the second act, Nora’s psychological condition has begun to erode, and the stage directions also show that the tree is “dishevelled”</li>\n<li>At the start of Act 2, it is described as “stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its dishevelled branches”: it is starting to contrast the usually contrasting connotations it carries\n<ul>\n<li>It currently suggests the continuation of Nora's confusion and belief in the illusion of Helmer accepting and forgiving her actions.</li>\n<li>Therefore, the tree is a symbol to Nora’s psychological state</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Year's Day</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Both Nora and Torvald look forward to New Year’s as a start of a happier live: Torvald will start his new job and certifies extra money and respect the job will give him, and Nora also looks forward to his job as she will be able to repay her debt to Krogstad</li>\n<li>By the end of the play, however, the nature of the nre start of Newy Year changes dramatically for both of them: they both become new people and face radically changed ways of living</li>\n<li>Hence the new year comes to mark the beginning of a truly new and different period in both their lives and their personalities</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tarantella</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It was believed that when someone was bitten by one, the only way to get rid of the venom was to dance and sweat it out</li>\n<li>In the dance scene, Nora is dancing excitedly as she is worried about the consequences of her actions</li>\n<li>Her dancing can be seen as a way for her to get rid of as much poison as possible so that she does not affect her children</li>\n<li>It is not a regular dance, as she is very emotional</li>\n<li>Helmer, the man, is contollering her, and asking her to calm down, having no clue why she is hysterical\n<ul>\n<li>Her psychological state is also described as “distracted” from the impending … (find quote)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Doll</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>At the exposition, Nora notes that dolls are quite cheap and easily breakable [<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.9x7rpt4yhono\">combined points</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lamp (32)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In Act 2, the lamp creates a dramatic moment as More symbolically exploits her new light with Dr Rank</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Context</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Bourgeois\n<ul>\n<li>This means belonging to or characteristic of the <strong>middle class</strong>, typically with reference to its perceived materialistic values or conventional attitudes</li>\n<li>Bourgeois could also be used to describe conventional people in the 1800s, when economies were growing rapidly leading to people with more wealth, and changing priorities</li>\n<li>Krogstad and Torvald are the embodiment of the bourgeoisie while Nora is a victim</li>\n<li>The bourgeoisie lifestyle is brought out through Torvald\n<ul>\n<li>He symbolizes the average man of that time period, and is described to money-minded, self-righteous, and selfish</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He lives under the allusion of him having total control over his family members; this is evident as he treats Nora akin to a “doll”, and casually fires Krogstad for a petty reason</li>\n<li>When Nora tells him about the forgery, he abandons his facade of love for her and gets angry, and when Krogstad threat’s disappear, he goes back to his former self, demonstrating his hypocritical nature</li>\n<li>Nora was expected to behave hike a typical bourgeoisie women by Torvald, but instead, as the play progresses, she slowly starts to go against the norms of the society, and at the end of the play she openly defies them and separates herself from these values</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Metamorphosis</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This is described as a change of the form of a thing or person to something completely different: the process of <strong>transformation from an immature form to an adult</strong></li>\n<li>At the end of the play, Nora metamorphoses as she is self-awakened\n<ul>\n<li>She undergoes this change when she realizes that Torvald does not have any real respect for her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Women’s emancipation\n<ul>\n<li>This was the effort to secure equal rights for women at the remove any gender discrimination from laws and behavioural patterns</li>\n<li>In the play, we see an <strong>imbalance in power</strong> through the was Nora is treated by Helmer</li>\n<li>She is treated like his “pet” or “property”, and it is evident that Krogstad and Dr. Rank do not take her seriously either as she is a woman</li>\n<li>Additionally, she speaks about the sense of “pride” she got from travelling to Italy as it makes her feel “almost like a man”</li>\n<li>At the end she realizes that she is not being treated like an equal and hence decides to leave</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Feminism\n<ul>\n<li>It is the belief that both men and women should be provided equal rights and opportunities</li>\n<li><em>A Doll’s House</em> starts with a stereotypical portrayal of women as financially dependent one men, incapable of making decisions or taking care of themselves</li>\n<li>The way Helmer treats his wife is demeaning and makes Nora seem like a “doll” to be played with and controlled</li>\n<li>However, as the play progresses, we she that she is bright enough to make her own decisions for herself: this ranges from her small lies to the secrecy about both borrowing and forging\n<ul>\n<li>She is clever as she is able to manipulate her way around.</li>\n<li>We then see her transform into a responsible individual; this is emphasized by the act of her leaving everything she was previously dependent one and looking out for herself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The play being set in 1879 was described as “<strong>a play phenomenally ahead of its time</strong>”\n<ul>\n<li>At first, the gender stereotypes were being conformed to around the world and patriarchal societies were the norm</li>\n<li>Since then, women have been fighting for equality, and the feminist movement started.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Social facades and hypocrisy\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>facade</strong> refers to a false appearance or way of behaving that hides what someone or something really is\n<ul>\n<li>This is prevalent in society as people tend to portray themselves in a way different from their true nature in order to fit in with societal norms</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Hypocrisy</strong> is the practise of claiming to have higher standards or more noble beliefs that is the case</li>\n<li>Nora was putting up a submissive and helpless <strong>facade</strong> in front of her husband and the rest of the society to fit in with societal expectations from a woman, when in reality she does have the strength and wit (as we see through the way she handles the situation)</li>\n<li>This theme is also brought out by Helmer towards the end of the play as he is more concerned about his appearance in society than his wife</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Idealist\n<ul>\n<li>An idealist is someone who believes that very good things can be achieved, often when it seems unlikely to others</li>\n<li><em>A Doll’s House</em> deals with aesthetic idealism</li>\n<li>Helmer is the personification of the idealis: noble, high morals, refined taste\n<ul>\n<li>Appearances and aesthetics to him are key, as laid out through the opening</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>His home is carefully decorated: carpeted floors, engravings, and a piano, an expensive item</li>\n<li>The ideal he sees in Nora is nothing but a reflection of himself: he is infatuated by her beauty and wants to control her</li>\n<li>Nora is the ideal wife catering to his ideal tastes, and behind this fantasy lies a desire for authority in Helmer</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Patriarchy\n<ul>\n<li>It is a social or governmental system in which males hold primary power and dominant roles while women are largely excluded from it. These roles include political leadership, moral authority, social privilege, and control of property</li>\n<li>Patriarchal is demonstrated through Helmer as a typical male in the society: he makes all the decisions and controls Nora’s allowance</li>\n<li>He treats Nora like a child, and also attempts to control her smallest actions, such as eating macaroons\n<ul>\n<li>This reinforces that she has unknowingly taken the role as a “doll”, a toy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Despite Nora's capabilities, she is forbidden from taking charge and making decisions in her own way; she is forced to follow his will, which in turn leaves her suppressed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Social class and hierarchy\n<ul>\n<li>Class refers to societal division based on economic and social status while hierarchy refers to people being grouped into different social categories (upper, middle, lower)</li>\n<li>The play takes place in a Norwegian town in 1979 where there were separated classes in the society, and men were expected to be the head of the family, while women were expected to work at home, without any true power</li>\n<li>The play occurred after a time of economic progress, so that middle class was recently made more wealthy</li>\n<li>This is made clear with the house which is “comfortably and tastefully furnished”, and the fact that they have servants</li>\n<li>Additionally, Nora's behaviour with Krogstad supports this: she feels superior to him as he is a member of the lower class</li>\n<li>Furthermore, when Nora and Mrs Linde talk about their husbands, Mrs Linde says that she “didn't think it would be right for [her] to refuse him”. This reiterates the fact that women would get married to improve their status in the society.</li>\n<li>There is also a prominent difference between men and women of the same societal class. Nora, a woman, was only expected to have knowledge on domestic affairs\n<ul>\n<li>For this reason, she did not tell Torvald that she borrowed money to save his life as it would be “painful and humiliating … with his manly self respect, to know that he owed anything to me.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This concept is still important today because in many countries there is still a strong divide between the lower, working, and upper class. Women’s rights have increased in recent years.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Reception\n<ul>\n<li>The play gave rise to debate and controversy, and people fixated one the fact that Nora left her family and responsibilities being because at that time, the greatest responsibility of a woman was not to herself but to her family</li>\n<li>For this reason, Ibsen was forced to write an alternate ending for the German theaters as it was unacceptable. Ibsen called the alternative ending “barbaric”, and a “disgrace” to the play. This incident indicated how strong the ideologies of that time were, and how event Ibsen, a man standing against those ideologies, was forced to give in at a certain point.</li>\n<li>Presently readers understand Nora’s decisions, but readers are often appalled at the restrictions placed on women in these times</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Genre: realism</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ibsen was a realist playwright as he wrote this play on actual problems in a typical household at the time. He shows an iconoclast in the society</li>\n<li>The setting also makes it realistic: it is a middle-class bourgeoisie house, and all the action takes place there, hence the audience can easily relate to the issues demonstrated</li>\n<li>There are also very common props with dramatic effects (such as the Christmas tree showing Nora’s mental state)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Themes</h1>\n<h2>Sacrificial role of women</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>There are many instances of sacrificial in the play: Mrs Linde abandoned Krogstad to marry a richer man, the nursemaid abandoned her own children to support herself, and Nora left her children to get a better life for herself</li>\n<li>Although Nora was economically advantaged compared to the other females, she nevertheless lead a difficult life because socially dictated that Torvald be the marriage’s dominant partner\n<ul>\n<li>Torvald condescends Nora, and she had to hide her loan from him because she knows that he could never accept that he is debt to his wife</li>\n<li>She also had to work in secret to pay back the loan</li>\n<li>In the end, this makes her vulnerable to Krogstad’s blackmail because she has no one to go to for help but herself.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The nursemaid’s story serves as a foreshadowing tool as Nora also ends up leaving her husband and children with her\n<ul>\n<li>This, in a way, makes the audience judge her less as we know that their children are left under good hands</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Parental and filial obligations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora, Torvald, and Dr Rank each express the belief that a parent is obligated to be honest and upstanding, because a parent’s immorality is passed on to their children like a disease: “A fog of lies like that in a household, and it spreads disease and infection to every past of it. Every breath the children take in that kind of house is reeking evil germs”</li>\n<li>In fact, Dr Rank does have a disease which is a direct result of his father's depravity, and he also implies that his father’s immorality (affairs with women) led him to contract a disease that he passed on to his son, leading him to suffer for his father’s misdeeds [find quote]</li>\n<li>Torvald also strongly believes that one's parents determine one’s moral character with the line: “Nearly all young criminals had lying mothers”, and he also refuses to allow Nora to interact with their children after he learns of her deceit, for fear that she will corrupt them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Unreliability of appearances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In the play, appearances are often misleading and mask the reality of the characters and their situations: our first impressions of Nora, Torvald, and Krogstad are eventually undercut. Nora first seems like a childish silly women, but as the play goes on, we see her intelligent, motivated, and by the play’s conclusion, a strong-willed independent thinker\n<ul>\n<li>Torvald, though he plays the part of a strong benevolent husband, reveals himself to be <strong>cowardly, petty, and selfish</strong> and he fears Krogstad may expose him to scandal</li>\n<li>Krogstad reveals himself to be much more <strong>sympathetic and merciful</strong> than what he first appears to be.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The play’s climax is a matter of resolving identity confusion:\n<ul>\n<li>Krogstad as a sympathetic and merciful lover</li>\n<li>Nora as an intelligent, independent woman who can make her own decisions, and one who has agency</li>\n<li>Torvald as someone who only cares about themselves, and one who never cared about his wife</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Situations are not only misinterpreted by the audience, but also by the characters\n<ul>\n<li>The hatred between Mrs Linde and Krogstad turns out to be love</li>\n<li>Nora’s creditor turns out to be Krogstad, and not Dr Rank, as we see Mrs Linde suppose</li>\n<li>Dr Rank confesses that he is in love with Nora</li>\n<li>The seemingly villainous Krogstad repents and returns Nora’s contract to her, while the seemingly kindhearted Mrs Linde ceases to help Nora and forces Torvald’s discovery of Nora’s secret.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The appearances within the Helmer Household results from Torvald’s devotion to an image at the expense of the creation of true happiness\n<ul>\n<li>Because he craves respect, image is very important to him, and hence he gets angry when disrespected: when Nora calls him petty and when Krogstad address him by his first name</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>By the end of the play, it is clear that while controlling his home’s appearance and his separated suppression and denial of reality have harmed his family and his happiness irreparably</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Love and marriage</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The entire play is seen as an exploration of love</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Individual and society</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A doll is a thing whose character is determined by the owner according to the functions it is expected to serve. It does not play any major role and is never removed from the home\n<ul>\n<li>In Act 3, Nora says “I believe that before all else I am a reasonable human being”, and is also claiming the right to her<strong>self</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Similar to a doll, in the first two acts, she never leaves the house (she doesn't leave without Helmer), and she is restricted as she cannot enter his study (point expanded on above)\n<ul>\n<li>However, in Act 3, she finally leaves the house on her own decision and decides to make a life for herself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>At the beginning of the play, her identity is determined by others: for Helmer, she is a sexual partner, a mother, and a housekeeper</li>\n<li>She forges a signature, she assumes that assumes that it will have no effect on who she is. To her, interaction with the outer world is like “being a man”\n<ul>\n<li>This shows that at the start of the play, Nora is a stereotypical women who agrees and does not question the societal gender roles</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After Krostead takes back the blackmail, Helmer feels that he can grant Nora the roles of a mother and wife again without issues, but this is when Nora doesn't agree and decides to leave the home: Nora no longer accepts him as the authority in the relationship (she cannot allow him to redefine motherhood), so she leaves to learn more about herself</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Disease and inheritance</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When Nora asks for money, Helmer replies: “It is in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora”\n<ul>\n<li>However, later we learn that Nora is only pretending to share her father’s extravagance as the money is going to pay off her debt to Krogstad</li>\n<li>Her father was likely knowling in fraud and corruption, but her crime is due to her ignorance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Similarly, Dr Rank also has a biological illness that he inherited, and he didn't marry so that the illness could die with him</li>\n<li>Both Helmer and Dr Rank use the <strong>metaphor</strong> of corrupt behaviour as moral sickness\n<ul>\n<li>For Helmer, this sickness invariably spreads, and its source is at home, and can also infect the children with the “germs of evil”.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The play is full of graphic images of death: Rank describes his own body: “rotting in the churchyard”, and Nora seems to intend to die in the “icy, black water”\n<ul>\n<li>However, Krogstad and Nora understand that suicide is not a noble sacrifice</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Money</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora borrows money to do something useful, but the money is not represented in actual money, but rather as a piece of paper (link to the motif of paper), which is an evidence of the crime she committed</li>\n<li>Her criminal act has brought her into a new world which is <strong>male-dominated</strong>: she proclaims her place in a world of “quarterly interest” and “installments”</li>\n<li>Helmer is quick to condemn Nora; although his job at the bank involves borrowing and lending money, he does not want a debt\n<ul>\n<li>This brings out the irony and the hypocrisy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Home</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora’s once home in Act 1 becomes a prison in which she feels she has been trapped and restricted [find quote] in Act 3, so she decided to leave</li>\n<li>Nora is called skylark, squirrel, songbird, all of which are wild creatures\n<ul>\n<li>This can be linked to the fact that the house is a cage for Nora, and it is also shown as she is not even given access to her own house (see above)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Language and style</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Helmer always refers to Nora by a nickname or patronizing adjective such as “little”, followed by “lark”, “songbird”, “squirrel”, and he often uses the possessive pronoun “my”</li>\n<li>Nora has many soliloquies throughout the play\n<ul>\n<li>For example, at the end of Act 2, Nora says to herself: “Five o'clock. Seven hours until midnight; and then four-and-twenty hours until the next midnight. Then the Tarantella will be over. Twenty-four and seven? Thirty-one hours to live.”</li>\n<li>The bird names also depict the weakness of Nora\n<ul>\n<li>Torvald saw this as a way to control her, by making her weaker than she already is</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Structure</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The play follows the structure of a <strong>well-made play</strong>: the exposition sets up the situation through the conversations, and the audience are informed with everything they know to understand what has already happened</li>\n<li>We are also aware that the situation is pressing as Nora is in crisis, and Act 1 ends on a note of high suspense and drama with Krogstad's demand</li>\n<li>In Act 2, we see Nora struggle to find a way out of the situation: first she tries to change Helmer’s mind, then she tries to act Dr. Rank for help, then when all the solutions change, Krogstad changes the demands by making them more serious</li>\n<li>Nora’s dissertation, using her tarantella to postpone the inevitable creates a high dramatic impact</li>\n<li>In Act 3, the suspense is developed further by Ibsen creating possible resolution of the letter being destroyed. More suspense is also created as Dr Rank delays Helmer’s reading of the letter</li>\n<li>The play ends with the dramatic confrontation of Nora and Helmer. Nora’s leaving at that time allows the play to end dramatically\n<ul>\n<li>Had she taken time to decide, all the dramatic impact would have been lost</li>\n<li>Furthermore, she also left at that moment to ensure that the play has unity of time</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The play ends in Christmas with “greatest miracle of all”, which is a possible redemption for Torvald as he seems to have understood the role of Nora in his live as a lover</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quotes</h1>\n<h2>Act 1</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>‘A Room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not <strong>extravagantly</strong>’\n<ul>\n<li>Provides evidence to the lifestyle and setting of the typical family of the hardworking and successful middle class</li>\n<li>Realistic setting, reflecting the typical upper middle class household at the time</li>\n<li>Creates a universal appeal as well</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nora: “We have not needed to economize”; “… earn <strong>lots and lots</strong> of money”\n<ul>\n<li>Repetition shows pride of middle class in money earned</li>\n<li>Elite part of the society</li>\n<li>It also shows that she is naïve in terms of money, but we later see that she has been saving for quite a while\n<ul>\n<li>She is quite excited as she is almost done paying off her debt</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nora: “I even hinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry”\n<ul>\n<li>Strict and conservative views of Torvald who represents the majority of the working middle class at the time</li>\n<li>Shows that Nora is not the naïve women Torvald sees her to be</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nora: “So you are quite alone. How dreadfully sad”\n<ul>\n<li>Shows how according to Nora, Christine’s entire life revolves around her husband and children, and that she cannot imagine her life being separated from them\n<ul>\n<li>Even though she wanted her agency, she was a stereotypical woman who was confirming to the stereotypes until she decided to leave and make a life of her own</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Christine is pitied</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Act 2</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>When a poor girl’s been in trouble she must take the best of things: the nursemaid</li>\n<li>Nora (31): “Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learnt at Capri.\n<ul>\n<li>She is dressing up exactly how Helmer wants her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Kristine (31): “I see; you are going to keep up the character”\n<ul>\n<li>This brings in some irony, as she says that she will “keep up the character”, as if she knows that the marriage is just an illusion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Kristine (31): “But, my deases Nora, how do you know anything about such things”\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to Helmer, Kristine also treats Nora like a child and does not think she is intelligent</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nora: “Torvald is so absurfly fond of me that he wants me absolutely to himself”\n<ul>\n<li>She mistakes his attitudes as love and romance</li>\n<li>She is lost in her utopian illusions</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nora: “Torvald can't bear to see dressmaking going on”\n<ul>\n<li>Only wants to see perfection: the house is meant to be kept as he pleases</li>\n<li>The dressmaking is messy work, which Torvald can’t bear to see, similar to why Dr. Rank doesn't want Helmer to see his dead body</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nora (34): “If your little squirrel were to ask you for something very, very prettily–”\n<ul>\n<li>Shows that men have dominance in the household, and they make all the important decisions</li>\n<li>Women were dependent on men for everything, including getting money/allowance: they are financially dependent on men</li>\n<li>Therefore, Nora must seduce and manipulate her husband in order to get him to do something she needs or wants</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Helmer (35): “Is it to get about now that the new manager has changed his mind at his wife’s bidding”\n<ul>\n<li>He thinks he will be judged if his wife, a woman, were able to change his mind</li>\n<li>His appearance is very important to him and he wants to show that he is independent</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Helmer (35): “if only this obstinate little person can get her way!”\n<ul>\n<li>He doesn't treat Nora as an equal individual, rather he treats her like a child</li>\n<li>His views are clearly more important to him</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Rank (38): “You are a greater rascal than I thought”</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Not only does Torvald treating Nora like a child, but even Dr Rank does</li>\n<li>This shows that men had a higher position on the society</li>\n<li>Women were supposed to be submissive towards the men</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>Rank (40): “Nora––do you think he is the only one––?”\n<ul>\n<li>Dr Rank expressed his love for Nora</li>\n<li>This is what causes Nora not to ask him for the money</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Krogstad (43): “It would not be the least like our dear Torvald Helmer to show so much courage”\n<ul>\n<li>He mocks Torvald offstage</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Krogstad (44): “Or even something worse–– …… Give up the idea”\n<ul>\n<li>Krogstad knows that Nora will likely commit suicide, so he tries to persuade her not to</li>\n<li>He has been the same situation before, so he knows how she will think</li>\n<li>Although he is the villain, he cares about Nora, more than Torvald himself does</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Krogstad (44): “For the last year and a half I have not had a hand in anything dishonorable”\n<ul>\n<li>We, as audience, learn that Krogstad is an honest man, and also a victim of circumstances</li>\n<li>Helmer’s reasons for wanting to fire him are mostly personal as he is not respected by him; Helmer is likely being quite unreasonable</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Krogstad (45): “Oh, you can’t frighten me. A fine, spoilt lady like you––”</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Act 3</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Krogstad: “I am a shipwrecked man clinging to a bit of wreckage”\n<ul>\n<li>Contrasts the relation between Helmer and Nora</li>\n<li>There is mutual respect and reciprocation in the relation of Krogstad and Christine</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Christine: “Nils, give me someone and something to work for”\n<ul>\n<li>In this relation, Christine proposes to Krogstad, and is hence classified as an iconoclast</li>\n<li>This differentiates their relationship, there is mutual respect and reciprocation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Helmer: “Why shouldn't I look at my dearest treasure?--at all the beauty that is mine, all my very own?”\n<ul>\n<li>Possessive and controlling, objectifies by calling her his treasure</li>\n<li>He talks to her as if he owns her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Notes</h1>\n<h2>Unities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Time: it makes it dramatic that she leaves the house right at that time\n<ul>\n<li>If she waited to think, the dramatic impact that was built up in their conversation would be lost</li>\n<li>The play ends with a high dramatic impact.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Place: the play takes place in a single place</li>\n<li>Action: there is mainly one plot\n<ul>\n<li>Although there is a subplot, it reinforces the main plot (The misunderstandings and dysfunctional marriage of Nora and Helmer)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SImilarities in the crimes of Krogstad and Nora</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Krogstad was disrupted as he forged a signature for greed and personal/family advancement\n<ul>\n<li>He underwent unethical means to advance his family and himself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nora also forged a signature to save mostly her family</li>\n<li>In the end, both paid a price</li>\n<li>Both have been marginalized by society or their family\n<ul>\n<li>Krogstad was marginalized professionally and socially</li>\n<li>Nora on accounts of her gender</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Both are “poisoning” their children with crime\n<ul>\n<li>Torvald blames Nora for her bad “genes”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The idea of <strong>inherited madness</strong> is also seen in Wide Sargasso Sea, and is used against characters</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dr Rank’s interactions with Nora</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Early on in the play, we learn that Dr Rank and Nora are good friends, and he is considered an equal to Helmer</li>\n<li>Helmer also trusts Dr Rank to be left alone with Nora</li>\n<li>In Act 2, when Nora tries to borrow the money from Dr Rank, we see Nora have an adult conversation with someone for the first time\n<ul>\n<li>Helmer and Kristine both treated her like a child, like someone who is protected from the harsh realities of life, although we as audience know that she is not</li>\n<li>Her interaction with Dr Rank goes against her constant infantilizing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Dr Rank and Nora’s interaction create a <strong>subtext</strong>, which is when unspoken ideas and emotions are shown\n<ul>\n<li>Both Nora and Dr Rank speak in code, making it clear that Nora understands his situation</li>\n<li>Dr Rank develops on Helmer’s point about hereditary, and his comparison to Nora’s father</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nora’s departure and ending</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The protagonist took a crucial decision to leave her family after understanding that she had lived in illusion for the past years: she wanted to face reality.</li>\n<li>She was blinded from the truth by comfort; she was trapped in domestic comfort and gets everything she wants, while losing touch with the outside world and consequently realizing the truth</li>\n<li>She first realizes that she is not truly loved when she is prevented from eating what she loved</li>\n<li>She was expecting a miracle in which her husband would save her from the danger, but instead when she witnessed the complete opposite, and hence she revolted and left him\n<ul>\n<li>She has always obeyed his wished and expected him to save her</li>\n<li>It came as a shock to her that he only cared about himself..</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She also found out that she had no identity, as it was completely shaped by her father and husband. She was deprived of speech and action, and hence decided to leave Torvald. When the forgery was revealed, she was made aware that her relationship with her husband was not mutual. She also found an imbalance in power distribution between her husband and her as Torvald was the dominant one. She made nothing out of her life as she had been living under the shadow of other men (Torvald and her father: she says she has “been greatly wronged, Torvald––first by papa and then by you”). She decides to leave the Helmer household and experience the world for herself</li>\n<li>Essentially, she wants to discover who she really is, she wants to educate herself\n<ul>\n<li>She is willing to break her marriage in doing so, demonstrating that she has agency.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nora’s independent nature is in direct contrast with the tyrannical authority of Torvald\n<ul>\n<li>They both are not truthful to each other</li>\n<li>When Torvald is proved to be disloyal and ungrateful, she leaves in order to find a better life for herself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Through the course of the play, Nora grows, and reveals all the flaws in her relationship with Torvald; she exposes him</li>\n<li>Her development and transformation as a women leads to her emancipation</li>\n<li><strong>However</strong>, she is going back to her father’s place to inherit all of his wealth, so she really isn't doing anything other than leaving him\n<ul>\n<li>She is still going to be protected with her father’s house and saving, so it is questionable whether she is going to make a life for herself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Self-awakening</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora's illusions about her family life are shattered by Helmer’s selfish and insensitive reaction to the news of Nora’s forgery: “What a horrible awakening! All these eight years--she who was my joy and pride--a hypocrite, a liar--worse, worse--a criminal!”\n<ul>\n<li>Helmer’s outburst grows her self-awakening, and Nora is finally able to see the truth in Helmer's character</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Communication</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The play begins with superficial communications and dialogs: Torvald calls Nora his “little lark” and a “featherhead”\n<ul>\n<li>Nora exhibits a sense of false childishness in her actions such as “turning around quickly” and getting excited at the mention of money; she is also “playing with his coat buttons”</li>\n<li>Torvald also seems to be close to Nora (false sense of closeness) with actions such as “taking her playfully by the ear” and “wagging his finger at her”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These are all non-verbal communications, but they do not give a correct idea of their relationship</li>\n<li>Later, we see Nora speaking to other characters such as Kristine and Krogstad more seriously\n<ul>\n<li>She divulges her secrets to Mrs Linde</li>\n<li>She appears more <strong>familiar</strong> and <strong>relaxed</strong> with Dr Rank</li>\n<li>She says “Well, I’m damned” in front of them, something she would never say in front of Torvald</li>\n<li>This reinforces the difference in her relationship with Torvald and Dr Rank/Kristine</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Her conversation with Krogstad is also quite different\n<ul>\n<li>She is calm, composed, and quite serious, showing her ability to achieve a <strong>serious conversation</strong></li>\n<li>She also shows <strong>confidence</strong> as she says that “one has a tiny little bit of influence”</li>\n<li>She does not speak seriously in front to Torvald, apart from the end of the play</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The lack of communication led to the ending of the relationship\n<ul>\n<li>Torvald was unable to understand Nora due to their poor communication</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",attributes:{title:"A Doll's House

she does not mind her doll-like existence in which she is pampered and patronized\n    *   But as the play progresses, we learn that she is not just a “**silly girl**” like Torvald calls her and she understands what business is\n    *   She is more **clever and manipulative** than Helmer thinks.\n*   The fact that Torvald is alive indicates that she is more intelligent that Torvald thinks she is, and her description of her secret labor undertaken to pay off her debt shows her **determination and ambition** to protect herself and her husband (protecting her husband from being in debt to her)\n    *   However, she is **naïve** in the sense that she thinks that the law will understand her motivation\n    *   But it remains: the fact that she was willing to break the law in order to ensure Torvald’s health shows her courage and love for him\n    *   However, later we learn that this **love is not mutual**, which is why she decides to leave him\n*   At the start, she does not know that she is participating in an **unequal** marriage\n    *   It is clear to the audience that the marriage is unequal as she does not even have a key to enter the house\n    *   Furthermore, she is reluctant to open or knock on the door of Helmer’s study, implying that she does not have a full access to the house\n*   Krogstad’s blackmail do not change Nora’s nature, rather they open her up to her unfulfilled and underappreciated potential: “I have been performing tricks for you, Torvald”; she has pretended to be someone she is not to fulfill the role that Torvald, her father, and the society have expected of her\n*   Nora’s **awakening** is complete with Tolvald's severe and selfish reaction after learning her deception and forgery; it is the final catalyst\n    *   Although this marks her awakening, she has been defying Torvald in small yet meaningful ways (eating macaroons then lying), which eventually led up to her making her own decision of leaving\n    *   As audience, we already know that she is capable of defying authorities in small ways (as she ate the macaroons)\n*   At the end of the play, there is a slight role reversal: at the start, Nora was expected to ask Torvald Helmer whether he could do anything\n    *   But at the end, we see Helmer begging her to stay as she leaves.\n*   For Nora, the main growth is her process of **self-discovery** as she transitions from a flighty girl in Act 1 to a sober figure seated at the table with Helmer in Act 3\n*   At the end, she finally understands that her husband has made her into an object to be played with and to be molded to their own liking: her personality has been largely constructed by others, and she has become an object to be played with or looked at, and she decides to shape a new herself\n*   Nora has emerged from a “silly” and weak girl to a feminist hero, more aware of her position in the household and in the society\n    *   She starts off by revealing her childish qualities, but as the play progresses, she proves that she is not just a silly, childish women; she is a strong, courageous, and valiant character, capable of adapting to change\n*   At the end when Torvald tells her that she must be a mother, she replies by saying that she is first and foremost a human being, hence she decided to make a decision that will benefit her she has been oppressed\n\n\n### Torvald Helmer\n\n\n\n*   Nora’s husband, who is happy with his new position at the bank, as he has authority\n*   He treats Nora **patronizingly** like a child and does not view her as an equal, but rather as a **doll** that he can play with and tease\n*   He is overly concerned with his place and **status** in the society, and he allows his emotions to be swayed heavily by the prospect of society’s respect and the fear of society’s scorn\n*   He believes that a man’s role in marriage is to protect and guide the wife, and clearly enjoys that Nora needs his guidance, and hence he interacts with her as if he is her father rather than an equal husband\n*   He **instructs** her by saying “A home that depends on loans and debt is not beautiful because it is not free”, almost sounding like he is trying to **force his opinions** on her, and he also teaches Nora the dance and likes to envision himself as Nora’s saviour: “do you know that I’ve often wished you were facing some terrible dangers so that I could risk life and limb, risk everything, for your sake?”\n*   Although he seizes power in the relationship and refers to Nora as a “girl”, it seems that Torvald is actually the weaker and more **childlike** character\n    *   This is clear with Dr. Rank’s explanation for not wanting Torvald to enter is sickroom: “Torvald is so fastidious, he can't face up to anything ugly”; Dr Rank fears Torvald must be **sheltered** like a child from the **realities** of the world\n    *   Furthermore, his decision to fire Krogstad stems ultimately from the fact that he feels threatened and offended by Krogstad’s failure to pay him proper respect.\n*   He is very conscious of other **people’s perceptions** of him and of standing up in the community; his explanation for rejecting Nora’s request that Krogstad be kept on at the office is that it would make him “a laughing stock before the entire staff\n    *   This demonstrates that he prioritizes his reputation over his wife’s desires\n    *   Additionally, he further indicates his deep **need for society’s respect** in his reaction to Nora’s deception: although he says that Nora has ruined his happiness and will not be allowed to raise the children, he insists that she remain in the house because of his concern in saving “**the appearance**” of their household.\n*   He enjoys **objectifying** his wife and showing off her beauty: he tells Dr Rank “worth seeing, if you ask me!”, and Nora tells Mrs Linde that Helmer wants to “keep me all to himself”\n*   He trusts her enough to leave her alone with Dr Rank, but after learning that he is going to die, he says “now that you and I have no one but each other”, suggesting that he is **indifferent** to Dr Rank leaving them.\n*   He enforces rules and seems to be a person of integrity, and he feels that he is entitled to judge Krogstad\n    *   He is a conformist as he **does not question** rules and the society – he is also absent from the debate about moral health and the community in Act 1 between Nora and Dr Rank \n*   He gives Nora no opportunity to explain herself\n    *   This is **ironic** because she is able to express her pain and discuss the complexity of the situation with Krogstad, the antagonist of the play, but not her own husband\n    *   This links to the differences in **communication**, which ultimately leads to the end of their marriage\n*   He takes the rules of the society for granted: he feels that he cannot be questioned since he is a husband and employer: he feels that he has authority as he controls Nora, down to eating the macaroons\n    *   He also believes he is an **idealist**, as he **stage-manages** Nora’s dance and lectures Kristine about knitting and embroidering, although he could have been drunk at the time\n*   He praises Nora for the tarantella dance, but then continues to take a condescending tone with her\n    *   He undermines her by saying, “**Do you think I was going to let her remain there after and spoil the affect?**”\n    *   It shows that he only cares about himself and his appearance, and that his wife must always follow and do what he says\n    *   He treats her as if she is his possession rather than another human being: this is brought out further by all of the names he calls her such as “capricious little Caprice maiden”, which shows that he does not think of her as an equal\n    *   He feels that he has a higher status and more importance in the family, while she is only there for his pleasure\n*   He never realizes that he is more interested in power than the rights and wrongs of a situation\n*   Although he imagines himself to stand for common sense, although he is quite dramatic himself: “Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake”, and hence conforms to the **stereotypical** image of a male hero\n*   However, this “**hero**” disintegrates when he says “**I’m saved**”, as he seems to disregard Nora completely\n    *   This follows as he says “I will protect you like a hunted dove that I have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating heart”, which come in direct contrast his **egoistic** attitude of saying “I’m saved!”\n*   Although Helmer is the least admirable character, and is clearly **self-centered**, he is not consciously selfish in his own gain at the expense of others\n    *   He is **blissfully unaware** of the harsh realities, such as the doctors keeping the illnesses from him\n\n\n### Krogstad\n\n\n\n*   A lawyer who used to work with Torvald, who is going to get fired by him\n*   His character is **contradictory**: although he wants to protect his children, he is willing to use unethical tactics to do so\n*   Although he causes sufference to Nora, he feels **sympathy** for her\n    *   This, in a way, differentiates him from Helmer\n    *   It is also **ironic** that the antagonist is able to feel sympathy, while Helmer himself only cares about himself\n*   He is the **antagonist** in the play, although he is **not necessarily the villain**. He tries to justify his behaviour by saying: “Even money-lenders, hacks, well, a man like me, can have a little of what you call feeling, you know.”\n    *   Ibsen has not created one-sided binary characters, but rather each character has a spectrum of emotions and empathies, making them more realistic\n    *   Hence the play is a modern play\n*   Through his willingness to allow Nora's torment to continue is cruel, he still has **sympathy** for her\n    *   He also visits her to check on her and discourage her from committing suicide.\n*   He has reasonable motives for behaving as he does: he wants to keep his job at the bank in order to spare his children from the hardships that come from a spoiled reputation\n    *   This separates him from Torvald: Torvald seems to desire respect from selfish reasons, while Krogstad desires it for his family’s sake\n*   His character is also similar to that of Nora’s: both have been wronged by society, and both of them have committed the same crime: forgery of signatures\n    *   Through he did break the law, Krogstad’s crime was minor, but the society still saw him as a criminal\n    *   He can also be seen as a **victim of circumstances** as he was abandoned by Mrs Linde for a man with more money\n    *   Therefore, it can be said that society forced Mrs Linde away from him and prompted his crime\n\n\n### Mrs Linde\n\n\n\n*   Nora’s childhood friend, she is a practical, down-to-earth women\n*   Her account of living in poverty highlights **Nora’s privileged nature**\n*   We learn that **she took responsibility** for her sick parents whereas Nora abandoned her father when he was ill\n*   Usually male expresses love, but Mrs Linde is a shipwreck, to make it more poignant, she says she is in the wreckage\n\n\n### Dr Rank\n\n\n\n*   Torvald’s best friend, he is one character who remains **unconcerned** about what others think of him\n*   He avoids talking to Torvald about his death out of respect for his distaste for ugliness and things that are not perfect\n*   He is the personification of Torald’s thoughts of “diseases” in the “household” that spread to the children\n*   He is the play’s detached observer, a common element of well-made plays\n*   He is in love with Nora, and has more than a desire for her\n\n\n### Nursemaid (Anne-Marie)\n\n\n\n*   The Helmer’s nursemaid, who has an **affection** for Nora as she had to give up her own child to take the nursing job\n*   She shares with Nora and Mrs Linde the act of sacrificing her own happiness out of economic necessity\n*   Nora’s concern at how cold she is suggests that she is more interested in the children's enjoyment than her own comfort\n*   It is the nurse who is **responsible** for the fact that Nora feels most comfortable with people who are not authoritative figures such as the servants or Dr Rank\n*   It is clear that Nora trusts her enough to bring up the children in her own absence when she leaves Helmer at the end, and this reduces the judgement she receives from the audience as the children are left in good hands\n    *   This, in a way, also redeems Nora’s character as we know that the children will be safe\n*   She is a character who has suffered the most through poverty and disgrace, and also betrayed by another man, so she had no choice but to give up her own children\n    *   Her suffering is in great contrast to the other characters as Krogstad still got to keep his children\n    *   Her character can be a role model for Nora, showing that it is possible to make a new life for yourself\n\n\n## Motifs\n\n\n### Nora’s definition of **freedom**\n\n\n\n*   Nora's understanding of freedom evolves over the course of the play\n*   In Act 1, she believes that she will be totally “free” when she has repaid the debt as she can then devote herself to her domestic responsibilities with ease\n*   However, after Krogstad blackmails her, she reconsiders and questions whether she is happy in Torvald’s house, where she is subjected to his orders\n*   By the end of the play, she seeks a new kind of freedom; she wants the be relieved of her familial obligations to pursue her own ambitions, beliefs, and identity\n\n\n### Letters and **paper**\n\n\n\n*   Majority of the plot twists involve the reading and writing of **letters**, which in the play represent the **unpleasant truth**, and situations obscured by Torvald and Nora’s beautification\n*   Krogstad writes two letters: one revealing Nora’s crime of forgery and the other retracting his blackmail threat\n    *   The **first letter** represents the truth about Nora’s past and initiates the inevitable dissolution of her marriage (she says “We are lost”)\n    *   Her attempts to stall Torvald from reading the letter represent her continue denial of the true nature of her marriage: at first even she does not realize that her marriage is an illusion\n    *   The **second letter** releases Nora from her obligation to Krogstad and represents her release from her obligation to Torvald\n    *   Upon reading it, Torvald attempts to return to his and Nora’s previous **denial of reality**, but Nora recognizes that the letter have exposed the truth about his selfishness, and hence she can no longer participate in the illusion of a happy marriage.\n*   Dr Rank’s method of communicating his imminent death is to leave his calling card marked with a black cross in Torvald’s letterbox\n*   This is because Torvald has an unwillingness to accept reality when he proclaims, “Torvald is so fastidious, he cannot act up to anything ugly”\n*   Mrs Linde also sends a note to Krogstad which initiates her life-changing meeting with him, and Torvald’s letter of dismissal to Krogstad\n*   The letter serves as a catalyst in the play, similar to in Wide Sargasso Sea, when Daniel writes a letter \n\n\n### Doors\n\n\n\n*   The door slamming is quite a **dramatic** moment for a play\n    *   It is quite shocking as it is a result of all the **tension** built up from the beginning of the play\n*   Usually dialog was used to show dramatic elements, but now an action and sound is used\n*   In the play, the doors usually show changes in mood\n*   Krogstad uses the back door when he comes in to be stealthy as he plans something nefarious, while Nora walks out confidentially out of the front door to show her agency\n*   Doors could represent the difference in what men and women had the ability to do in the patriarchal society\n    *   For example, Nora never left the house, she was almost trapped by Helmer as she does not have access to her own house\n    *   Furthermore, she is not permitted to enter Helmer’s study, and she has to use her ears to listen\n    *   The state of women is clearly brought out as Nora had to **rebel** in her own house.\n*   Doors are also metaphors of the marital relationship, similar to a barrier between Nora and Torvald and how they do not understand each other.\n*   Similar to Nora, the nursemaid also left her house because the husband couldn't not fulfill the duties of earning enough money, so she had to leave to earn money\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n### The christmas tree\n\n\n\n*   Symbolizes **Nora's position in her household** as a **plaything** which is pleasing to look at and adds charm to the house\n*   Nora instructs the maid that the children can't see the tree until it has been decorated, and she also tells Torvald that no one can see her in her dress until the evening of the dance\n*   At the beginning of the second act, Nora’s psychological condition has begun to erode, and the stage directions also show that the tree is “dishevelled”\n*   At the start of Act 2, it is described as “stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its dishevelled branches”: it is starting to contrast the usually contrasting connotations it carries\n    *   It currently suggests the continuation of Nora's confusion and belief in the illusion of Helmer accepting and forgiving her actions.\n    *   Therefore, the tree is a symbol to Nora’s psychological state\n\n\n### New Year's Day\t\n\n\n\n*   Both Nora and Torvald look forward to New Year’s as a start of a happier live: Torvald will start his new job and certifies extra money and respect the job will give him, and Nora also looks forward to his job as she will be able to repay her debt to Krogstad\n*   By the end of the play, however, the nature of the nre start of Newy Year changes dramatically for both of them: they both become new people and face radically changed ways of living\n*   Hence the new year comes to mark the beginning of a truly new and different period in both their lives and their personalities\n\n\n### Tarantella\n\n\n\n*   It was believed that when someone was bitten by one, the only way to get rid of the venom was to dance and sweat it out\n*   In the dance scene, Nora is dancing excitedly as she is worried about the consequences of her actions\n*   Her dancing can be seen as a way for her to get rid of as much poison as possible so that she does not affect her children\n*   It is not a regular dance, as she is very emotional\n*   Helmer, the man, is contollering her, and asking her to calm down, having no clue why she is hysterical\n    *   Her psychological state is also described as “distracted” from the impending … (find quote)\n\n\n### Doll\n\n\n\n*   At the exposition, Nora notes that dolls are quite cheap and easily breakable [[combined points](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.9x7rpt4yhono)]\n\n\n### Lamp (32)\n\n\n\n*   In Act 2, the lamp creates a dramatic moment as More symbolically exploits her new light with Dr Rank\n\n\n## Context\n\n\n\n1. Bourgeois\n    *   This means belonging to or characteristic of the **middle class**, typically with reference to its perceived materialistic values or conventional attitudes\n    *   Bourgeois could also be used to describe conventional people in the 1800s, when economies were growing rapidly leading to people with more wealth, and changing priorities\n    *   Krogstad and Torvald are the embodiment of the bourgeoisie while Nora is a victim\n    *   The bourgeoisie lifestyle is brought out through Torvald\n        *   He symbolizes the average man of that time period, and is described to money-minded, self-righteous, and selfish\n    *   He lives under the allusion of him having total control over his family members; this is evident as he treats Nora akin to a “doll”, and casually fires Krogstad for a petty reason\n    *   When Nora tells him about the forgery, he abandons his facade of love for her and gets angry, and when Krogstad threat’s disappear, he goes back to his former self, demonstrating his hypocritical nature\n    *   Nora was expected to behave hike a typical bourgeoisie women by Torvald, but instead, as the play progresses, she slowly starts to go against the norms of the society, and at the end of the play she openly defies them and separates herself from these values\n2. **Metamorphosis**\n    *   This is described as a change of the form of a thing or person to something completely different: the process of **transformation from an immature form to an adult**\n    *   At the end of the play, Nora metamorphoses as she is self-awakened\n        *   She undergoes this change when she realizes that Torvald does not have any real respect for her\n3. Women’s emancipation\n    *   This was the effort to secure equal rights for women at the remove any gender discrimination from laws and behavioural patterns\n    *   In the play, we see an **imbalance in power** through the was Nora is treated by Helmer\n    *   She is treated like his “pet” or “property”, and it is evident that Krogstad and Dr. Rank do not take her seriously either as she is a woman\n    *   Additionally, she speaks about the sense of “pride” she got from travelling to Italy as it makes her feel “almost like a man”\n    *   At the end she realizes that she is not being treated like an equal and hence decides to leave\n4. Feminism\n    *   It is the belief that both men and women should be provided equal rights and opportunities\n    *   _A Doll’s House_ starts with a stereotypical portrayal of women as financially dependent one men, incapable of making decisions or taking care of themselves\n    *   The way Helmer treats his wife is demeaning and makes Nora seem like a “doll” to be played with and controlled\n    *   However, as the play progresses, we she that she is bright enough to make her own decisions for herself: this ranges from her small lies to the secrecy about both borrowing and forging\n        *   She is clever as she is able to manipulate her way around.\n        *   We then see her transform into a responsible individual; this is emphasized by the act of her leaving everything she was previously dependent one and looking out for herself\n    *   The play being set in 1879 was described as “**a play phenomenally ahead of its time**”\n        *   At first, the gender stereotypes were being conformed to around the world and patriarchal societies were the norm\n        *   Since then, women have been fighting for equality, and the feminist movement started.\n5. Social facades and hypocrisy\n    *   A **facade** refers to a false appearance or way of behaving that hides what someone or something really is\n        *   This is prevalent in society as people tend to portray themselves in a way different from their true nature in order to fit in with societal norms\n    *   **Hypocrisy** is the practise of claiming to have higher standards or more noble beliefs that is the case\n    *   Nora was putting up a submissive and helpless **facade** in front of her husband and the rest of the society to fit in with societal expectations from a woman, when in reality she does have the strength and wit (as we see through the way she handles the situation)\n    *   This theme is also brought out by Helmer towards the end of the play as he is more concerned about his appearance in society than his wife\n6. Idealist\n    *   An idealist is someone who believes that very good things can be achieved, often when it seems unlikely to others\n    *   _A Doll’s House_ deals with aesthetic idealism\n    *   Helmer is the personification of the idealis: noble, high morals, refined taste\n        *   Appearances and aesthetics to him are key, as laid out through the opening\n    *   His home is carefully decorated: carpeted floors, engravings, and a piano, an expensive item\n    *   The ideal he sees in Nora is nothing but a reflection of himself: he is infatuated by her beauty and wants to control her\n    *   Nora is the ideal wife catering to his ideal tastes, and behind this fantasy lies a desire for authority in Helmer\n7. Patriarchy\n    *   It is a social or governmental system in which males hold primary power and dominant roles while women are largely excluded from it. These roles include political leadership, moral authority, social privilege, and control of property\n    *   Patriarchal is demonstrated through Helmer as a typical male in the society: he makes all the decisions and controls Nora’s allowance\n    *   He treats Nora like a child, and also attempts to control her smallest actions, such as eating macaroons\n        *   This reinforces that she has unknowingly taken the role as a “doll”, a toy\n    *   Despite Nora's capabilities, she is forbidden from taking charge and making decisions in her own way; she is forced to follow his will, which in turn leaves her suppressed\n8. Social class and hierarchy\n    *   Class refers to societal division based on economic and social status while hierarchy refers to people being grouped into different social categories (upper, middle, lower)\n    *   The play takes place in a Norwegian town in 1979 where there were separated classes in the society, and men were expected to be the head of the family, while women were expected to work at home, without any true power\n    *   The play occurred after a time of economic progress, so that middle class was recently made more wealthy\n    *   This is made clear with the house which is “comfortably and tastefully furnished”, and the fact that they have servants\n    *   Additionally, Nora's behaviour with Krogstad supports this: she feels superior to him as he is a member of the lower class\n    *   Furthermore, when Nora and Mrs Linde talk about their husbands, Mrs Linde says that she “didn't think it would be right for [her] to refuse him”. This reiterates the fact that women would get married to improve their status in the society.\n    *   There is also a prominent difference between men and women of the same societal class. Nora, a woman, was only expected to have knowledge on domestic affairs\n        *   For this reason, she did not tell Torvald that she borrowed money to save his life as it would be “painful and humiliating … with his manly self respect, to know that he owed anything to me.”\n    *   This concept is still important today because in many countries there is still a strong divide between the lower, working, and upper class. Women’s rights have increased in recent years.\n9. Reception\n    *   The play gave rise to debate and controversy, and people fixated one the fact that Nora left her family and responsibilities being because at that time, the greatest responsibility of a woman was not to herself but to her family\n    *   For this reason, Ibsen was forced to write an alternate ending for the German theaters as it was unacceptable. Ibsen called the alternative ending “barbaric”, and a “disgrace” to the play. This incident indicated how strong the ideologies of that time were, and how event Ibsen, a man standing against those ideologies, was forced to give in at a certain point.\n    *   Presently readers understand Nora’s decisions, but readers are often appalled at the restrictions placed on women in these times\n\n\n### Genre: realism\n\n\n\n*   Ibsen was a realist playwright as he wrote this play on actual problems in a typical household at the time. He shows an iconoclast in the society\n*   The setting also makes it realistic: it is a middle-class bourgeoisie house, and all the action takes place there, hence the audience can easily relate to the issues demonstrated\n*   There are also very common props with dramatic effects (such as the Christmas tree showing Nora’s mental state)\n\n\n# Themes\n\n\n## Sacrificial role of women\n\n\n\n*   There are many instances of sacrificial in the play: Mrs Linde abandoned Krogstad to marry a richer man, the nursemaid abandoned her own children to support herself, and Nora left her children to get a better life for herself\n*   Although Nora was economically advantaged compared to the other females, she nevertheless lead a difficult life because socially dictated that Torvald be the marriage’s dominant partner\n    *   Torvald condescends Nora, and she had to hide her loan from him because she knows that he could never accept that he is debt to his wife\n    *   She also had to work in secret to pay back the loan\n    *   In the end, this makes her vulnerable to Krogstad’s blackmail because she has no one to go to for help but herself.\n*   The nursemaid’s story serves as a foreshadowing tool as Nora also ends up leaving her husband and children with her\n    *   This, in a way, makes the audience judge her less as we know that their children are left under good hands\n\n\n## Parental and filial obligations\n\n\n\n*   Nora, Torvald, and Dr Rank each express the belief that a parent is obligated to be honest and upstanding, because a parent’s immorality is passed on to their children like a disease: “A fog of lies like that in a household, and it spreads disease and infection to every past of it. Every breath the children take in that kind of house is reeking evil germs”\n*   In fact, Dr Rank does have a disease which is a direct result of his father's depravity, and he also implies that his father’s immorality (affairs with women) led him to contract a disease that he passed on to his son, leading him to suffer for his father’s misdeeds [find quote]\n*   Torvald also strongly believes that one's parents determine one’s moral character with the line: “Nearly all young criminals had lying mothers”, and he also refuses to allow Nora to interact with their children after he learns of her deceit, for fear that she will corrupt them.\n\n\n## Unreliability of appearances\t\n\n\n\n*   In the play, appearances are often misleading and mask the reality of the characters and their situations: our first impressions of Nora, Torvald, and Krogstad are eventually undercut. Nora first seems like a childish silly women, but as the play goes on, we see her intelligent, motivated, and by the play’s conclusion, a strong-willed independent thinker\n    *   Torvald, though he plays the part of a strong benevolent husband, reveals himself to be **cowardly, petty, and selfish** and he fears Krogstad may expose him to scandal\n    *   Krogstad reveals himself to be much more **sympathetic and merciful** than what he first appears to be.\n*   The play’s climax is a matter of resolving identity confusion:\n    *   Krogstad as a sympathetic and merciful lover\n    *   Nora as an intelligent, independent woman who can make her own decisions, and one who has agency\n    *   Torvald as someone who only cares about themselves, and one who never cared about his wife\n*   Situations are not only misinterpreted by the audience, but also by the characters\n    *   The hatred between Mrs Linde and Krogstad turns out to be love\n    *   Nora’s creditor turns out to be Krogstad, and not Dr Rank, as we see Mrs Linde suppose\n    *   Dr Rank confesses that he is in love with Nora\n    *   The seemingly villainous Krogstad repents and returns Nora’s contract to her, while the seemingly kindhearted Mrs Linde ceases to help Nora and forces Torvald’s discovery of Nora’s secret.\n*   The appearances within the Helmer Household results from Torvald’s devotion to an image at the expense of the creation of true happiness\n    *   Because he craves respect, image is very important to him, and hence he gets angry when disrespected: when Nora calls him petty and when Krogstad address him by his first name\n*   By the end of the play, it is clear that while controlling his home’s appearance and his separated suppression and denial of reality have harmed his family and his happiness irreparably\n\n\n## Love and marriage\n\n\n\n*   The entire play is seen as an exploration of love\n\n\n## Individual and society\n\n\n\n*   A doll is a thing whose character is determined by the owner according to the functions it is expected to serve. It does not play any major role and is never removed from the home\n    *   In Act 3, Nora says “I believe that before all else I am a reasonable human being”, and is also claiming the right to her**self**.\n*   Similar to a doll, in the first two acts, she never leaves the house (she doesn't leave without Helmer), and she is restricted as she cannot enter his study (point expanded on above)\n    *   However, in Act 3, she finally leaves the house on her own decision and decides to make a life for herself\n*   At the beginning of the play, her identity is determined by others: for Helmer, she is a sexual partner, a mother, and a housekeeper\n*   She forges a signature, she assumes that assumes that it will have no effect on who she is. To her, interaction with the outer world is like “being a man”\n    *   This shows that at the start of the play, Nora is a stereotypical women who agrees and does not question the societal gender roles\n*   After Krostead takes back the blackmail, Helmer feels that he can grant Nora the roles of a mother and wife again without issues, but this is when Nora doesn't agree and decides to leave the home: Nora no longer accepts him as the authority in the relationship (she cannot allow him to redefine motherhood), so she leaves to learn more about herself\n\n\n## Disease and inheritance\n\n\n\n*   When Nora asks for money, Helmer replies: “It is in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora”\n    *   However, later we learn that Nora is only pretending to share her father’s extravagance as the money is going to pay off her debt to Krogstad\n    *   Her father was likely knowling in fraud and corruption, but her crime is due to her ignorance.\n*   Similarly, Dr Rank also has a biological illness that he inherited, and he didn't marry so that the illness could die with him\n*   Both Helmer and Dr Rank use the **metaphor** of corrupt behaviour as moral sickness\n    *   For Helmer, this sickness invariably spreads, and its source is at home, and can also infect the children with the “germs of evil”.\n*   The play is full of graphic images of death: Rank describes his own body: “rotting in the churchyard”, and Nora seems to intend to die in the “icy, black water”\n    *   However, Krogstad and Nora understand that suicide is not a noble sacrifice\n\n\n## Money\n\n\n\n*   Nora borrows money to do something useful, but the money is not represented in actual money, but rather as a piece of paper (link to the motif of paper), which is an evidence of the crime she committed \n*   Her criminal act has brought her into a new world which is **male-dominated**: she proclaims her place in a world of “quarterly interest” and “installments”\n*   Helmer is quick to condemn Nora; although his job at the bank involves borrowing and lending money, he does not want a debt\n    *   This brings out the irony and the hypocrisy\n\n\n## Home\n\n\n\n*   Nora’s once home in Act 1 becomes a prison in which she feels she has been trapped and restricted [find quote] in Act 3, so she decided to leave\n*   Nora is called skylark, squirrel, songbird, all of which are wild creatures\n    *   This can be linked to the fact that the house is a cage for Nora, and it is also shown as she is not even given access to her own house (see above)\n\n\n# Language and style\n\n\n\n*   Helmer always refers to Nora by a nickname or patronizing adjective such as “little”, followed by “lark”, “songbird”, “squirrel”, and he often uses the possessive pronoun “my”\n*   Nora has many soliloquies throughout the play\n    *   For example, at the end of Act 2, Nora says to herself: “Five o'clock. Seven hours until midnight; and then four-and-twenty hours until the next midnight. Then the Tarantella will be over. Twenty-four and seven? Thirty-one hours to live.”\n    *   The bird names also depict the weakness of Nora\n        *   Torvald saw this as a way to control her, by making her weaker than she already is\n\n\n# Structure\n\n\n\n*   The play follows the structure of a **well-made play**: the exposition sets up the situation through the conversations, and the audience are informed with everything they know to understand what has already happened\n*   We are also aware that the situation is pressing as Nora is in crisis, and Act 1 ends on a note of high suspense and drama with Krogstad's demand\n*   In Act 2, we see Nora struggle to find a way out of the situation: first she tries to change Helmer’s mind, then she tries to act Dr. Rank for help, then when all the solutions change, Krogstad changes the demands by making them more serious\n*   Nora’s dissertation, using her tarantella to postpone the inevitable creates a high dramatic impact\n*   In Act 3, the suspense is developed further by Ibsen creating possible resolution of the letter being destroyed. More suspense is also created as Dr Rank delays Helmer’s reading of the letter\n*   The play ends with the dramatic confrontation of Nora and Helmer. Nora’s leaving at that time allows the play to end dramatically\n    *   Had she taken time to decide, all the dramatic impact would have been lost\n    *   Furthermore, she also left at that moment to ensure that the play has unity of time\n*   The play ends in Christmas with “greatest miracle of all”, which is a possible redemption for Torvald as he seems to have understood the role of Nora in his live as a lover\n\n\n# Quotes\n\n\n## Act 1\n\n\n\n1. ‘A Room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not **extravagantly**’\n    *   Provides evidence to the lifestyle and setting of the typical family of the hardworking and successful middle class\n    *   Realistic setting, reflecting the typical upper middle class household at the time\n    *   Creates a universal appeal as well\n2. Nora: “We have not needed to economize”; “… earn **lots and lots** of money”\n    *   Repetition shows pride of middle class in money earned\n    *   Elite part of the society\n    *   It also shows that she is naïve in terms of money, but we later see that she has been saving for quite a while\n        *   She is quite excited as she is almost done paying off her debt\n3. Nora: “I even hinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry”\n    *   Strict and conservative views of Torvald who represents the majority of the working middle class at the time\n    *   Shows that Nora is not the naïve women Torvald sees her to be\n4. Nora: “So you are quite alone. How dreadfully sad”\n    *   Shows how according to Nora, Christine’s entire life revolves around her husband and children, and that she cannot imagine her life being separated from them\n        *   Even though she wanted her agency, she was a stereotypical woman who was confirming to the stereotypes until she decided to leave and make a life of her own\n    *   Christine is pitied\n\n\n## Act 2\n\n\n\n1. When a poor girl’s been in trouble she must take the best of things: the nursemaid\n2. Nora (31): “Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learnt at Capri.\n    *   She is dressing up exactly how Helmer wants her\n3. Kristine (31): “I see; you are going to keep up the character”\t\n    *   This brings in some irony, as she says that she will “keep up the character”, as if she knows that the marriage is just an illusion\n4. Kristine (31): “But, my deases Nora, how do you know anything about such things”\n    *   Similar to Helmer, Kristine also treats Nora like a child and does not think she is intelligent\n5. Nora: “Torvald is so absurfly fond of me that he wants me absolutely to himself”\n    *   She mistakes his attitudes as love and romance\n    *   She is lost in her utopian illusions\n6. Nora: “Torvald can't bear to see dressmaking going on”\n    *   Only wants to see perfection: the house is meant to be kept as he pleases\n    *   The dressmaking is messy work, which Torvald can’t bear to see, similar to why Dr. Rank doesn't want Helmer to see his dead body\n7. Nora (34): “If your little squirrel were to ask you for something very, very prettily–”\n    *   Shows that men have dominance in the household, and they make all the important decisions\n    *   Women were dependent on men for everything, including getting money/allowance: they are financially dependent on men\n    *   Therefore, Nora must seduce and manipulate her husband in order to get him to do something she needs or wants\n8. Helmer (35): “Is it to get about now that the new manager has changed his mind at his wife’s bidding”\n    *   He thinks he will be judged if his wife, a woman, were able to change his mind\n    *   His appearance is very important to him and he wants to show that he is independent\n9. Helmer (35): “if only this obstinate little person can get her way!”\n    *   He doesn't treat Nora as an equal individual, rather he treats her like a child\n    *   His views are clearly more important to him\n10. Rank (38): “You are a greater rascal than I thought”\n   *   Not only does Torvald treating Nora like a child, but even Dr Rank does\n   *   This shows that men had a higher position on the society\n   *   Women were supposed to be submissive towards the men\n11. Rank (40): “Nora––do you think he is the only one––?”\n    *   Dr Rank expressed his love for Nora\n    *   This is what causes Nora not to ask him for the money\n12. Krogstad (43): “It would not be the least like our dear Torvald Helmer to show so much courage”\t\n    *   He mocks Torvald offstage\n13. Krogstad (44): “Or even something worse–– …… Give up the idea”\n    *   Krogstad knows that Nora will likely commit suicide, so he tries to persuade her not to\n    *   He has been the same situation before, so he knows how she will think\n    *   Although he is the villain, he cares about Nora, more than Torvald himself does\n14. Krogstad (44): “For the last year and a half I have not had a hand in anything dishonorable”\n    *   We, as audience, learn that Krogstad is an honest man, and also a victim of circumstances\n    *   Helmer’s reasons for wanting to fire him are mostly personal as he is not respected by him; Helmer is likely being quite unreasonable\n15. Krogstad (45): “Oh, you can’t frighten me. A fine, spoilt lady like you––”\n\n\n## Act 3\n\n\n\n1. Krogstad: “I am a shipwrecked man clinging to a bit of wreckage”\n    *   Contrasts the relation between Helmer and Nora\n    *   There is mutual respect and reciprocation in the relation of Krogstad and Christine\n2. Christine: “Nils, give me someone and something to work for”\n    *   In this relation, Christine proposes to Krogstad, and is hence classified as an iconoclast\n    *   This differentiates their relationship, there is mutual respect and reciprocation\n3. Helmer: “Why shouldn't I look at my dearest treasure?--at all the beauty that is mine, all my very own?”\n    *   Possessive and controlling, objectifies by calling her his treasure\n    *   He talks to her as if he owns her\n\n\n# Notes\n\n\n## Unities\n\n\n\n*   Time: it makes it dramatic that she leaves the house right at that time\n    *   If she waited to think, the dramatic impact that was built up in their conversation would be lost\n    *   The play ends with a high dramatic impact.\n*   Place: the play takes place in a single place\n*   Action: there is mainly one plot\n    *   Although there is a subplot, it reinforces the main plot (The misunderstandings and dysfunctional marriage of Nora and Helmer)\n\n\n### SImilarities in the crimes of Krogstad and Nora\n\n\n\n*   Krogstad was disrupted as he forged a signature for greed and personal/family advancement\n    *   He underwent unethical means to advance his family and himself\n*   Nora also forged a signature to save mostly her family\n*   In the end, both paid a price\n*   Both have been marginalized by society or their family\n    *   Krogstad was marginalized professionally and socially\n    *   Nora on accounts of her gender\n*   Both are “poisoning” their children with crime\n    *   Torvald blames Nora for her bad “genes”\n*   The idea of **inherited madness** is also seen in Wide Sargasso Sea, and is used against characters\n\n\n## Dr Rank’s interactions with Nora \n\n\n\n*   Early on in the play, we learn that Dr Rank and Nora are good friends, and he is considered an equal to Helmer\n*   Helmer also trusts Dr Rank to be left alone with Nora\n*   In Act 2, when Nora tries to borrow the money from Dr Rank, we see Nora have an adult conversation with someone for the first time\n    *   Helmer and Kristine both treated her like a child, like someone who is protected from the harsh realities of life, although we as audience know that she is not \n    *   Her interaction with Dr Rank goes against her constant infantilizing\n*   Dr Rank and Nora’s interaction create a **subtext**, which is when unspoken ideas and emotions are shown\n    *   Both Nora and Dr Rank speak in code, making it clear that Nora understands his situation\n    *   Dr Rank develops on Helmer’s point about hereditary, and his comparison to Nora’s father\n\n\n## Nora’s departure and ending\n\n\n\n*   The protagonist took a crucial decision to leave her family after understanding that she had lived in illusion for the past years: she wanted to face reality.\n*   She was blinded from the truth by comfort; she was trapped in domestic comfort and gets everything she wants, while losing touch with the outside world and consequently realizing the truth\n*   She first realizes that she is not truly loved when she is prevented from eating what she loved\n*   She was expecting a miracle in which her husband would save her from the danger, but instead when she witnessed the complete opposite, and hence she revolted and left him\n    *   She has always obeyed his wished and expected him to save her\n    *   It came as a shock to her that he only cared about himself..\n*   She also found out that she had no identity, as it was completely shaped by her father and husband. She was deprived of speech and action, and hence decided to leave Torvald. When the forgery was revealed, she was made aware that her relationship with her husband was not mutual. She also found an imbalance in power distribution between her husband and her as Torvald was the dominant one. She made nothing out of her life as she had been living under the shadow of other men (Torvald and her father: she says she has “been greatly wronged, Torvald––first by papa and then by you”). She decides to leave the Helmer household and experience the world for herself\n*   Essentially, she wants to discover who she really is, she wants to educate herself\n    *   She is willing to break her marriage in doing so, demonstrating that she has agency.\n*   Nora’s independent nature is in direct contrast with the tyrannical authority of Torvald\n    *   They both are not truthful to each other\n    *   When Torvald is proved to be disloyal and ungrateful, she leaves in order to find a better life for herself\n*   Through the course of the play, Nora grows, and reveals all the flaws in her relationship with Torvald; she exposes him\n*   Her development and transformation as a women leads to her emancipation\n*   **However**, she is going back to her father’s place to inherit all of his wealth, so she really isn't doing anything other than leaving him\n    *   She is still going to be protected with her father’s house and saving, so it is questionable whether she is going to make a life for herself\n\n\n## Self-awakening\n\n\n\n*   Nora's illusions about her family life are shattered by Helmer’s selfish and insensitive reaction to the news of Nora’s forgery: “What a horrible awakening! All these eight years--she who was my joy and pride--a hypocrite, a liar--worse, worse--a criminal!”\n    *   Helmer’s outburst grows her self-awakening, and Nora is finally able to see the truth in Helmer's character\n\n\n## Communication\n\n\n\n*   The play begins with superficial communications and dialogs: Torvald calls Nora his “little lark” and a “featherhead”\n    *   Nora exhibits a sense of false childishness in her actions such as “turning around quickly” and getting excited at the mention of money; she is also “playing with his coat buttons”\n    *   Torvald also seems to be close to Nora (false sense of closeness) with actions such as “taking her playfully by the ear” and “wagging his finger at her”\n*   These are all non-verbal communications, but they do not give a correct idea of their relationship\n*   Later, we see Nora speaking to other characters such as Kristine and Krogstad more seriously\n    *   She divulges her secrets to Mrs Linde\n    *   She appears more **familiar** and **relaxed** with Dr Rank\n    *   She says “Well, I’m damned” in front of them, something she would never say in front of Torvald\n    *   This reinforces the difference in her relationship with Torvald and Dr Rank/Kristine\n*   Her conversation with Krogstad is also quite different\n    *   She is calm, composed, and quite serious, showing her ability to achieve a **serious conversation**\n    *   She also shows **confidence** as she says that “one has a tiny little bit of influence”\n    *   She does not speak seriously in front to Torvald, apart from the end of the play\n*   The lack of communication led to the ending of the relationship\n    *   Torvald was unable to understand Nora due to their poor communication"},html:{writable:!0,enumerable:!0,value:"<h1>Forward</h1>\n<h2>Henrik Ibsen (author)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>After marrying and having children, he felt that rather than merely living together, the husband and wife should live as equals, free to become their own human beings</li>\n<li>However, critics attacked him for failing to respect the institution of marriage</li>\n<li>His writing created sensitive social issues and the Norwegian society frowned upon his work at first</li>\n<li>Father of Modern theater, he set out to develop serious ideas in a dramatic form</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Context</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Set in Victorian Norway in 1879</li>\n<li>The protagonist is very much like a real life character, as we see her slowly transform into a new character (metamorphosis)</li>\n<li>By the end of the play, she is a woman fighting for her opinions and against her conventional husband: this makes her a complex character</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Elements</h1>\n<h2>Characters</h2>\n<h3>Nora Helmer</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The protagonist of the play, she initially seems like a playful <strong>naïve</strong> child who lacks knowledge from the outside world, although we see later that she has experience of the outer world</li>\n<li>Her first word is “Hide”\n<ul>\n<li>This gives the audience an idea of her personality in nature of being secretive</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>act of rebellion</strong> with the macaroons indicates that she is <strong>not</strong> as innocent as she appears\n<ul>\n<li>The simple lie about eating the macaroons shows that she will lie when she needs to in order to escape certain situations</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She has a great <strong>zest</strong> (enthusiasm and energy): she takes pleasure in the Christmas tree, the taste of macaroons, and champagne\n<ul>\n<li>She is physically <strong>expressive and at ease</strong>, frequently kissing Helmer and playing affectionately with her children</li>\n<li>Her instinct is to reach out to people, and we do see her reach out to the nurse, Mrs Linde, and Dr Rank</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When we see her tarantella performance, we see she is a natural performer, turning to dance as a means of <strong>expressing what she cannot say</strong> (because societal constructs prevent her), and this draws awareness that she is <strong>‘performing’</strong> the role of wife which society has scripted for her\n<ul>\n<li>Later in the play, she starts to feel a resentment that she has to perform in order to ask Helmer for anything, and she realizes that she is not in an <strong>equal marriage</strong></li>\n<li>Later in the play, she is able to see her position in the marriage with an increasing clarity and finds the <strong>strength</strong> and <strong>agency</strong> to free herself from the oppressive position</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>At the start of the play, she responds affectionaley to Torvald’s teasing and is excited about the extra money she will get; she does not mind her doll-like existence in which she is pampered and patronized\n<ul>\n<li>But as the play progresses, we learn that she is not just a “<strong>silly girl</strong>” like Torvald calls her and she understands what business is</li>\n<li>She is more <strong>clever and manipulative</strong> than Helmer thinks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The fact that Torvald is alive indicates that she is more intelligent that Torvald thinks she is, and her description of her secret labor undertaken to pay off her debt shows her <strong>determination and ambition</strong> to protect herself and her husband (protecting her husband from being in debt to her)\n<ul>\n<li>However, she is <strong>naïve</strong> in the sense that she thinks that the law will understand her motivation</li>\n<li>But it remains: the fact that she was willing to break the law in order to ensure Torvald’s health shows her courage and love for him</li>\n<li>However, later we learn that this <strong>love is not mutual</strong>, which is why she decides to leave him</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>At the start, she does not know that she is participating in an <strong>unequal</strong> marriage\n<ul>\n<li>It is clear to the audience that the marriage is unequal as she does not even have a key to enter the house</li>\n<li>Furthermore, she is reluctant to open or knock on the door of Helmer’s study, implying that she does not have a full access to the house</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Krogstad’s blackmail do not change Nora’s nature, rather they open her up to her unfulfilled and underappreciated potential: “I have been performing tricks for you, Torvald”; she has pretended to be someone she is not to fulfill the role that Torvald, her father, and the society have expected of her</li>\n<li>Nora’s <strong>awakening</strong> is complete with Tolvald's severe and selfish reaction after learning her deception and forgery; it is the final catalyst\n<ul>\n<li>Although this marks her awakening, she has been defying Torvald in small yet meaningful ways (eating macaroons then lying), which eventually led up to her making her own decision of leaving</li>\n<li>As audience, we already know that she is capable of defying authorities in small ways (as she ate the macaroons)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>At the end of the play, there is a slight role reversal: at the start, Nora was expected to ask Torvald Helmer whether he could do anything\n<ul>\n<li>But at the end, we see Helmer begging her to stay as she leaves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For Nora, the main growth is her process of <strong>self-discovery</strong> as she transitions from a flighty girl in Act 1 to a sober figure seated at the table with Helmer in Act 3</li>\n<li>At the end, she finally understands that her husband has made her into an object to be played with and to be molded to their own liking: her personality has been largely constructed by others, and she has become an object to be played with or looked at, and she decides to shape a new herself</li>\n<li>Nora has emerged from a “silly” and weak girl to a feminist hero, more aware of her position in the household and in the society\n<ul>\n<li>She starts off by revealing her childish qualities, but as the play progresses, she proves that she is not just a silly, childish women; she is a strong, courageous, and valiant character, capable of adapting to change</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>At the end when Torvald tells her that she must be a mother, she replies by saying that she is first and foremost a human being, hence she decided to make a decision that will benefit her she has been oppressed</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Torvald Helmer</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora’s husband, who is happy with his new position at the bank, as he has authority</li>\n<li>He treats Nora <strong>patronizingly</strong> like a child and does not view her as an equal, but rather as a <strong>doll</strong> that he can play with and tease</li>\n<li>He is overly concerned with his place and <strong>status</strong> in the society, and he allows his emotions to be swayed heavily by the prospect of society’s respect and the fear of society’s scorn</li>\n<li>He believes that a man’s role in marriage is to protect and guide the wife, and clearly enjoys that Nora needs his guidance, and hence he interacts with her as if he is her father rather than an equal husband</li>\n<li>He <strong>instructs</strong> her by saying “A home that depends on loans and debt is not beautiful because it is not free”, almost sounding like he is trying to <strong>force his opinions</strong> on her, and he also teaches Nora the dance and likes to envision himself as Nora’s saviour: “do you know that I’ve often wished you were facing some terrible dangers so that I could risk life and limb, risk everything, for your sake?”</li>\n<li>Although he seizes power in the relationship and refers to Nora as a “girl”, it seems that Torvald is actually the weaker and more <strong>childlike</strong> character\n<ul>\n<li>This is clear with Dr. Rank’s explanation for not wanting Torvald to enter is sickroom: “Torvald is so fastidious, he can't face up to anything ugly”; Dr Rank fears Torvald must be <strong>sheltered</strong> like a child from the <strong>realities</strong> of the world</li>\n<li>Furthermore, his decision to fire Krogstad stems ultimately from the fact that he feels threatened and offended by Krogstad’s failure to pay him proper respect.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He is very conscious of other <strong>people’s perceptions</strong> of him and of standing up in the community; his explanation for rejecting Nora’s request that Krogstad be kept on at the office is that it would make him “a laughing stock before the entire staff\n<ul>\n<li>This demonstrates that he prioritizes his reputation over his wife’s desires</li>\n<li>Additionally, he further indicates his deep <strong>need for society’s respect</strong> in his reaction to Nora’s deception: although he says that Nora has ruined his happiness and will not be allowed to raise the children, he insists that she remain in the house because of his concern in saving “<strong>the appearance</strong>” of their household.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He enjoys <strong>objectifying</strong> his wife and showing off her beauty: he tells Dr Rank “worth seeing, if you ask me!”, and Nora tells Mrs Linde that Helmer wants to “keep me all to himself”</li>\n<li>He trusts her enough to leave her alone with Dr Rank, but after learning that he is going to die, he says “now that you and I have no one but each other”, suggesting that he is <strong>indifferent</strong> to Dr Rank leaving them.</li>\n<li>He enforces rules and seems to be a person of integrity, and he feels that he is entitled to judge Krogstad\n<ul>\n<li>He is a conformist as he <strong>does not question</strong> rules and the society – he is also absent from the debate about moral health and the community in Act 1 between Nora and Dr Rank</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He gives Nora no opportunity to explain herself\n<ul>\n<li>This is <strong>ironic</strong> because she is able to express her pain and discuss the complexity of the situation with Krogstad, the antagonist of the play, but not her own husband</li>\n<li>This links to the differences in <strong>communication</strong>, which ultimately leads to the end of their marriage</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He takes the rules of the society for granted: he feels that he cannot be questioned since he is a husband and employer: he feels that he has authority as he controls Nora, down to eating the macaroons\n<ul>\n<li>He also believes he is an <strong>idealist</strong>, as he <strong>stage-manages</strong> Nora’s dance and lectures Kristine about knitting and embroidering, although he could have been drunk at the time</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He praises Nora for the tarantella dance, but then continues to take a condescending tone with her\n<ul>\n<li>He undermines her by saying, “<strong>Do you think I was going to let her remain there after and spoil the affect?</strong>”</li>\n<li>It shows that he only cares about himself and his appearance, and that his wife must always follow and do what he says</li>\n<li>He treats her as if she is his possession rather than another human being: this is brought out further by all of the names he calls her such as “capricious little Caprice maiden”, which shows that he does not think of her as an equal</li>\n<li>He feels that he has a higher status and more importance in the family, while she is only there for his pleasure</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He never realizes that he is more interested in power than the rights and wrongs of a situation</li>\n<li>Although he imagines himself to stand for common sense, although he is quite dramatic himself: “Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake”, and hence conforms to the <strong>stereotypical</strong> image of a male hero</li>\n<li>However, this “<strong>hero</strong>” disintegrates when he says “<strong>I’m saved</strong>”, as he seems to disregard Nora completely\n<ul>\n<li>This follows as he says “I will protect you like a hunted dove that I have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating heart”, which come in direct contrast his <strong>egoistic</strong> attitude of saying “I’m saved!”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Although Helmer is the least admirable character, and is clearly <strong>self-centered</strong>, he is not consciously selfish in his own gain at the expense of others\n<ul>\n<li>He is <strong>blissfully unaware</strong> of the harsh realities, such as the doctors keeping the illnesses from him</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Krogstad</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A lawyer who used to work with Torvald, who is going to get fired by him</li>\n<li>His character is <strong>contradictory</strong>: although he wants to protect his children, he is willing to use unethical tactics to do so</li>\n<li>Although he causes sufference to Nora, he feels <strong>sympathy</strong> for her\n<ul>\n<li>This, in a way, differentiates him from Helmer</li>\n<li>It is also <strong>ironic</strong> that the antagonist is able to feel sympathy, while Helmer himself only cares about himself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He is the <strong>antagonist</strong> in the play, although he is <strong>not necessarily the villain</strong>. He tries to justify his behaviour by saying: “Even money-lenders, hacks, well, a man like me, can have a little of what you call feeling, you know.”\n<ul>\n<li>Ibsen has not created one-sided binary characters, but rather each character has a spectrum of emotions and empathies, making them more realistic</li>\n<li>Hence the play is a modern play</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Through his willingness to allow Nora's torment to continue is cruel, he still has <strong>sympathy</strong> for her\n<ul>\n<li>He also visits her to check on her and discourage her from committing suicide.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He has reasonable motives for behaving as he does: he wants to keep his job at the bank in order to spare his children from the hardships that come from a spoiled reputation\n<ul>\n<li>This separates him from Torvald: Torvald seems to desire respect from selfish reasons, while Krogstad desires it for his family’s sake</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>His character is also similar to that of Nora’s: both have been wronged by society, and both of them have committed the same crime: forgery of signatures\n<ul>\n<li>Through he did break the law, Krogstad’s crime was minor, but the society still saw him as a criminal</li>\n<li>He can also be seen as a <strong>victim of circumstances</strong> as he was abandoned by Mrs Linde for a man with more money</li>\n<li>Therefore, it can be said that society forced Mrs Linde away from him and prompted his crime</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mrs Linde</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora’s childhood friend, she is a practical, down-to-earth women</li>\n<li>Her account of living in poverty highlights <strong>Nora’s privileged nature</strong></li>\n<li>We learn that <strong>she took responsibility</strong> for her sick parents whereas Nora abandoned her father when he was ill</li>\n<li>Usually male expresses love, but Mrs Linde is a shipwreck, to make it more poignant, she says she is in the wreckage</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dr Rank</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Torvald’s best friend, he is one character who remains <strong>unconcerned</strong> about what others think of him</li>\n<li>He avoids talking to Torvald about his death out of respect for his distaste for ugliness and things that are not perfect</li>\n<li>He is the personification of Torald’s thoughts of “diseases” in the “household” that spread to the children</li>\n<li>He is the play’s detached observer, a common element of well-made plays</li>\n<li>He is in love with Nora, and has more than a desire for her</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Nursemaid (Anne-Marie)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Helmer’s nursemaid, who has an <strong>affection</strong> for Nora as she had to give up her own child to take the nursing job</li>\n<li>She shares with Nora and Mrs Linde the act of sacrificing her own happiness out of economic necessity</li>\n<li>Nora’s concern at how cold she is suggests that she is more interested in the children's enjoyment than her own comfort</li>\n<li>It is the nurse who is <strong>responsible</strong> for the fact that Nora feels most comfortable with people who are not authoritative figures such as the servants or Dr Rank</li>\n<li>It is clear that Nora trusts her enough to bring up the children in her own absence when she leaves Helmer at the end, and this reduces the judgement she receives from the audience as the children are left in good hands\n<ul>\n<li>This, in a way, also redeems Nora’s character as we know that the children will be safe</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She is a character who has suffered the most through poverty and disgrace, and also betrayed by another man, so she had no choice but to give up her own children\n<ul>\n<li>Her suffering is in great contrast to the other characters as Krogstad still got to keep his children</li>\n<li>Her character can be a role model for Nora, showing that it is possible to make a new life for yourself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Motifs</h2>\n<h3>Nora’s definition of <strong>freedom</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora's understanding of freedom evolves over the course of the play</li>\n<li>In Act 1, she believes that she will be totally “free” when she has repaid the debt as she can then devote herself to her domestic responsibilities with ease</li>\n<li>However, after Krogstad blackmails her, she reconsiders and questions whether she is happy in Torvald’s house, where she is subjected to his orders</li>\n<li>By the end of the play, she seeks a new kind of freedom; she wants the be relieved of her familial obligations to pursue her own ambitions, beliefs, and identity</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Letters and <strong>paper</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Majority of the plot twists involve the reading and writing of <strong>letters</strong>, which in the play represent the <strong>unpleasant truth</strong>, and situations obscured by Torvald and Nora’s beautification</li>\n<li>Krogstad writes two letters: one revealing Nora’s crime of forgery and the other retracting his blackmail threat\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>first letter</strong> represents the truth about Nora’s past and initiates the inevitable dissolution of her marriage (she says “We are lost”)</li>\n<li>Her attempts to stall Torvald from reading the letter represent her continue denial of the true nature of her marriage: at first even she does not realize that her marriage is an illusion</li>\n<li>The <strong>second letter</strong> releases Nora from her obligation to Krogstad and represents her release from her obligation to Torvald</li>\n<li>Upon reading it, Torvald attempts to return to his and Nora’s previous <strong>denial of reality</strong>, but Nora recognizes that the letter have exposed the truth about his selfishness, and hence she can no longer participate in the illusion of a happy marriage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Dr Rank’s method of communicating his imminent death is to leave his calling card marked with a black cross in Torvald’s letterbox</li>\n<li>This is because Torvald has an unwillingness to accept reality when he proclaims, “Torvald is so fastidious, he cannot act up to anything ugly”</li>\n<li>Mrs Linde also sends a note to Krogstad which initiates her life-changing meeting with him, and Torvald’s letter of dismissal to Krogstad</li>\n<li>The letter serves as a catalyst in the play, similar to in Wide Sargasso Sea, when Daniel writes a letter</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Doors</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The door slamming is quite a <strong>dramatic</strong> moment for a play\n<ul>\n<li>It is quite shocking as it is a result of all the <strong>tension</strong> built up from the beginning of the play</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Usually dialog was used to show dramatic elements, but now an action and sound is used</li>\n<li>In the play, the doors usually show changes in mood</li>\n<li>Krogstad uses the back door when he comes in to be stealthy as he plans something nefarious, while Nora walks out confidentially out of the front door to show her agency</li>\n<li>Doors could represent the difference in what men and women had the ability to do in the patriarchal society\n<ul>\n<li>For example, Nora never left the house, she was almost trapped by Helmer as she does not have access to her own house</li>\n<li>Furthermore, she is not permitted to enter Helmer’s study, and she has to use her ears to listen</li>\n<li>The state of women is clearly brought out as Nora had to <strong>rebel</strong> in her own house.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Doors are also metaphors of the marital relationship, similar to a barrier between Nora and Torvald and how they do not understand each other.</li>\n<li>Similar to Nora, the nursemaid also left her house because the husband couldn't not fulfill the duties of earning enough money, so she had to leave to earn money</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<h3>The christmas tree</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Symbolizes <strong>Nora's position in her household</strong> as a <strong>plaything</strong> which is pleasing to look at and adds charm to the house</li>\n<li>Nora instructs the maid that the children can't see the tree until it has been decorated, and she also tells Torvald that no one can see her in her dress until the evening of the dance</li>\n<li>At the beginning of the second act, Nora’s psychological condition has begun to erode, and the stage directions also show that the tree is “dishevelled”</li>\n<li>At the start of Act 2, it is described as “stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its dishevelled branches”: it is starting to contrast the usually contrasting connotations it carries\n<ul>\n<li>It currently suggests the continuation of Nora's confusion and belief in the illusion of Helmer accepting and forgiving her actions.</li>\n<li>Therefore, the tree is a symbol to Nora’s psychological state</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Year's Day</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Both Nora and Torvald look forward to New Year’s as a start of a happier live: Torvald will start his new job and certifies extra money and respect the job will give him, and Nora also looks forward to his job as she will be able to repay her debt to Krogstad</li>\n<li>By the end of the play, however, the nature of the nre start of Newy Year changes dramatically for both of them: they both become new people and face radically changed ways of living</li>\n<li>Hence the new year comes to mark the beginning of a truly new and different period in both their lives and their personalities</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tarantella</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It was believed that when someone was bitten by one, the only way to get rid of the venom was to dance and sweat it out</li>\n<li>In the dance scene, Nora is dancing excitedly as she is worried about the consequences of her actions</li>\n<li>Her dancing can be seen as a way for her to get rid of as much poison as possible so that she does not affect her children</li>\n<li>It is not a regular dance, as she is very emotional</li>\n<li>Helmer, the man, is contollering her, and asking her to calm down, having no clue why she is hysterical\n<ul>\n<li>Her psychological state is also described as “distracted” from the impending … (find quote)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Doll</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>At the exposition, Nora notes that dolls are quite cheap and easily breakable [<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.9x7rpt4yhono\">combined points</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lamp (32)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In Act 2, the lamp creates a dramatic moment as More symbolically exploits her new light with Dr Rank</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Context</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Bourgeois\n<ul>\n<li>This means belonging to or characteristic of the <strong>middle class</strong>, typically with reference to its perceived materialistic values or conventional attitudes</li>\n<li>Bourgeois could also be used to describe conventional people in the 1800s, when economies were growing rapidly leading to people with more wealth, and changing priorities</li>\n<li>Krogstad and Torvald are the embodiment of the bourgeoisie while Nora is a victim</li>\n<li>The bourgeoisie lifestyle is brought out through Torvald\n<ul>\n<li>He symbolizes the average man of that time period, and is described to money-minded, self-righteous, and selfish</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He lives under the allusion of him having total control over his family members; this is evident as he treats Nora akin to a “doll”, and casually fires Krogstad for a petty reason</li>\n<li>When Nora tells him about the forgery, he abandons his facade of love for her and gets angry, and when Krogstad threat’s disappear, he goes back to his former self, demonstrating his hypocritical nature</li>\n<li>Nora was expected to behave hike a typical bourgeoisie women by Torvald, but instead, as the play progresses, she slowly starts to go against the norms of the society, and at the end of the play she openly defies them and separates herself from these values</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Metamorphosis</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This is described as a change of the form of a thing or person to something completely different: the process of <strong>transformation from an immature form to an adult</strong></li>\n<li>At the end of the play, Nora metamorphoses as she is self-awakened\n<ul>\n<li>She undergoes this change when she realizes that Torvald does not have any real respect for her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Women’s emancipation\n<ul>\n<li>This was the effort to secure equal rights for women at the remove any gender discrimination from laws and behavioural patterns</li>\n<li>In the play, we see an <strong>imbalance in power</strong> through the was Nora is treated by Helmer</li>\n<li>She is treated like his “pet” or “property”, and it is evident that Krogstad and Dr. Rank do not take her seriously either as she is a woman</li>\n<li>Additionally, she speaks about the sense of “pride” she got from travelling to Italy as it makes her feel “almost like a man”</li>\n<li>At the end she realizes that she is not being treated like an equal and hence decides to leave</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Feminism\n<ul>\n<li>It is the belief that both men and women should be provided equal rights and opportunities</li>\n<li><em>A Doll’s House</em> starts with a stereotypical portrayal of women as financially dependent one men, incapable of making decisions or taking care of themselves</li>\n<li>The way Helmer treats his wife is demeaning and makes Nora seem like a “doll” to be played with and controlled</li>\n<li>However, as the play progresses, we she that she is bright enough to make her own decisions for herself: this ranges from her small lies to the secrecy about both borrowing and forging\n<ul>\n<li>She is clever as she is able to manipulate her way around.</li>\n<li>We then see her transform into a responsible individual; this is emphasized by the act of her leaving everything she was previously dependent one and looking out for herself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The play being set in 1879 was described as “<strong>a play phenomenally ahead of its time</strong>”\n<ul>\n<li>At first, the gender stereotypes were being conformed to around the world and patriarchal societies were the norm</li>\n<li>Since then, women have been fighting for equality, and the feminist movement started.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Social facades and hypocrisy\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>facade</strong> refers to a false appearance or way of behaving that hides what someone or something really is\n<ul>\n<li>This is prevalent in society as people tend to portray themselves in a way different from their true nature in order to fit in with societal norms</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Hypocrisy</strong> is the practise of claiming to have higher standards or more noble beliefs that is the case</li>\n<li>Nora was putting up a submissive and helpless <strong>facade</strong> in front of her husband and the rest of the society to fit in with societal expectations from a woman, when in reality she does have the strength and wit (as we see through the way she handles the situation)</li>\n<li>This theme is also brought out by Helmer towards the end of the play as he is more concerned about his appearance in society than his wife</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Idealist\n<ul>\n<li>An idealist is someone who believes that very good things can be achieved, often when it seems unlikely to others</li>\n<li><em>A Doll’s House</em> deals with aesthetic idealism</li>\n<li>Helmer is the personification of the idealis: noble, high morals, refined taste\n<ul>\n<li>Appearances and aesthetics to him are key, as laid out through the opening</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>His home is carefully decorated: carpeted floors, engravings, and a piano, an expensive item</li>\n<li>The ideal he sees in Nora is nothing but a reflection of himself: he is infatuated by her beauty and wants to control her</li>\n<li>Nora is the ideal wife catering to his ideal tastes, and behind this fantasy lies a desire for authority in Helmer</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Patriarchy\n<ul>\n<li>It is a social or governmental system in which males hold primary power and dominant roles while women are largely excluded from it. These roles include political leadership, moral authority, social privilege, and control of property</li>\n<li>Patriarchal is demonstrated through Helmer as a typical male in the society: he makes all the decisions and controls Nora’s allowance</li>\n<li>He treats Nora like a child, and also attempts to control her smallest actions, such as eating macaroons\n<ul>\n<li>This reinforces that she has unknowingly taken the role as a “doll”, a toy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Despite Nora's capabilities, she is forbidden from taking charge and making decisions in her own way; she is forced to follow his will, which in turn leaves her suppressed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Social class and hierarchy\n<ul>\n<li>Class refers to societal division based on economic and social status while hierarchy refers to people being grouped into different social categories (upper, middle, lower)</li>\n<li>The play takes place in a Norwegian town in 1979 where there were separated classes in the society, and men were expected to be the head of the family, while women were expected to work at home, without any true power</li>\n<li>The play occurred after a time of economic progress, so that middle class was recently made more wealthy</li>\n<li>This is made clear with the house which is “comfortably and tastefully furnished”, and the fact that they have servants</li>\n<li>Additionally, Nora's behaviour with Krogstad supports this: she feels superior to him as he is a member of the lower class</li>\n<li>Furthermore, when Nora and Mrs Linde talk about their husbands, Mrs Linde says that she “didn't think it would be right for [her] to refuse him”. This reiterates the fact that women would get married to improve their status in the society.</li>\n<li>There is also a prominent difference between men and women of the same societal class. Nora, a woman, was only expected to have knowledge on domestic affairs\n<ul>\n<li>For this reason, she did not tell Torvald that she borrowed money to save his life as it would be “painful and humiliating … with his manly self respect, to know that he owed anything to me.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This concept is still important today because in many countries there is still a strong divide between the lower, working, and upper class. Women’s rights have increased in recent years.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Reception\n<ul>\n<li>The play gave rise to debate and controversy, and people fixated one the fact that Nora left her family and responsibilities being because at that time, the greatest responsibility of a woman was not to herself but to her family</li>\n<li>For this reason, Ibsen was forced to write an alternate ending for the German theaters as it was unacceptable. Ibsen called the alternative ending “barbaric”, and a “disgrace” to the play. This incident indicated how strong the ideologies of that time were, and how event Ibsen, a man standing against those ideologies, was forced to give in at a certain point.</li>\n<li>Presently readers understand Nora’s decisions, but readers are often appalled at the restrictions placed on women in these times</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Genre: realism</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ibsen was a realist playwright as he wrote this play on actual problems in a typical household at the time. He shows an iconoclast in the society</li>\n<li>The setting also makes it realistic: it is a middle-class bourgeoisie house, and all the action takes place there, hence the audience can easily relate to the issues demonstrated</li>\n<li>There are also very common props with dramatic effects (such as the Christmas tree showing Nora’s mental state)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Themes</h1>\n<h2>Sacrificial role of women</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>There are many instances of sacrificial in the play: Mrs Linde abandoned Krogstad to marry a richer man, the nursemaid abandoned her own children to support herself, and Nora left her children to get a better life for herself</li>\n<li>Although Nora was economically advantaged compared to the other females, she nevertheless lead a difficult life because socially dictated that Torvald be the marriage’s dominant partner\n<ul>\n<li>Torvald condescends Nora, and she had to hide her loan from him because she knows that he could never accept that he is debt to his wife</li>\n<li>She also had to work in secret to pay back the loan</li>\n<li>In the end, this makes her vulnerable to Krogstad’s blackmail because she has no one to go to for help but herself.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The nursemaid’s story serves as a foreshadowing tool as Nora also ends up leaving her husband and children with her\n<ul>\n<li>This, in a way, makes the audience judge her less as we know that their children are left under good hands</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Parental and filial obligations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora, Torvald, and Dr Rank each express the belief that a parent is obligated to be honest and upstanding, because a parent’s immorality is passed on to their children like a disease: “A fog of lies like that in a household, and it spreads disease and infection to every past of it. Every breath the children take in that kind of house is reeking evil germs”</li>\n<li>In fact, Dr Rank does have a disease which is a direct result of his father's depravity, and he also implies that his father’s immorality (affairs with women) led him to contract a disease that he passed on to his son, leading him to suffer for his father’s misdeeds [find quote]</li>\n<li>Torvald also strongly believes that one's parents determine one’s moral character with the line: “Nearly all young criminals had lying mothers”, and he also refuses to allow Nora to interact with their children after he learns of her deceit, for fear that she will corrupt them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Unreliability of appearances</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In the play, appearances are often misleading and mask the reality of the characters and their situations: our first impressions of Nora, Torvald, and Krogstad are eventually undercut. Nora first seems like a childish silly women, but as the play goes on, we see her intelligent, motivated, and by the play’s conclusion, a strong-willed independent thinker\n<ul>\n<li>Torvald, though he plays the part of a strong benevolent husband, reveals himself to be <strong>cowardly, petty, and selfish</strong> and he fears Krogstad may expose him to scandal</li>\n<li>Krogstad reveals himself to be much more <strong>sympathetic and merciful</strong> than what he first appears to be.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The play’s climax is a matter of resolving identity confusion:\n<ul>\n<li>Krogstad as a sympathetic and merciful lover</li>\n<li>Nora as an intelligent, independent woman who can make her own decisions, and one who has agency</li>\n<li>Torvald as someone who only cares about themselves, and one who never cared about his wife</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Situations are not only misinterpreted by the audience, but also by the characters\n<ul>\n<li>The hatred between Mrs Linde and Krogstad turns out to be love</li>\n<li>Nora’s creditor turns out to be Krogstad, and not Dr Rank, as we see Mrs Linde suppose</li>\n<li>Dr Rank confesses that he is in love with Nora</li>\n<li>The seemingly villainous Krogstad repents and returns Nora’s contract to her, while the seemingly kindhearted Mrs Linde ceases to help Nora and forces Torvald’s discovery of Nora’s secret.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The appearances within the Helmer Household results from Torvald’s devotion to an image at the expense of the creation of true happiness\n<ul>\n<li>Because he craves respect, image is very important to him, and hence he gets angry when disrespected: when Nora calls him petty and when Krogstad address him by his first name</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>By the end of the play, it is clear that while controlling his home’s appearance and his separated suppression and denial of reality have harmed his family and his happiness irreparably</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Love and marriage</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The entire play is seen as an exploration of love</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Individual and society</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A doll is a thing whose character is determined by the owner according to the functions it is expected to serve. It does not play any major role and is never removed from the home\n<ul>\n<li>In Act 3, Nora says “I believe that before all else I am a reasonable human being”, and is also claiming the right to her<strong>self</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Similar to a doll, in the first two acts, she never leaves the house (she doesn't leave without Helmer), and she is restricted as she cannot enter his study (point expanded on above)\n<ul>\n<li>However, in Act 3, she finally leaves the house on her own decision and decides to make a life for herself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>At the beginning of the play, her identity is determined by others: for Helmer, she is a sexual partner, a mother, and a housekeeper</li>\n<li>She forges a signature, she assumes that assumes that it will have no effect on who she is. To her, interaction with the outer world is like “being a man”\n<ul>\n<li>This shows that at the start of the play, Nora is a stereotypical women who agrees and does not question the societal gender roles</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After Krostead takes back the blackmail, Helmer feels that he can grant Nora the roles of a mother and wife again without issues, but this is when Nora doesn't agree and decides to leave the home: Nora no longer accepts him as the authority in the relationship (she cannot allow him to redefine motherhood), so she leaves to learn more about herself</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Disease and inheritance</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When Nora asks for money, Helmer replies: “It is in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora”\n<ul>\n<li>However, later we learn that Nora is only pretending to share her father’s extravagance as the money is going to pay off her debt to Krogstad</li>\n<li>Her father was likely knowling in fraud and corruption, but her crime is due to her ignorance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Similarly, Dr Rank also has a biological illness that he inherited, and he didn't marry so that the illness could die with him</li>\n<li>Both Helmer and Dr Rank use the <strong>metaphor</strong> of corrupt behaviour as moral sickness\n<ul>\n<li>For Helmer, this sickness invariably spreads, and its source is at home, and can also infect the children with the “germs of evil”.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The play is full of graphic images of death: Rank describes his own body: “rotting in the churchyard”, and Nora seems to intend to die in the “icy, black water”\n<ul>\n<li>However, Krogstad and Nora understand that suicide is not a noble sacrifice</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Money</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora borrows money to do something useful, but the money is not represented in actual money, but rather as a piece of paper (link to the motif of paper), which is an evidence of the crime she committed</li>\n<li>Her criminal act has brought her into a new world which is <strong>male-dominated</strong>: she proclaims her place in a world of “quarterly interest” and “installments”</li>\n<li>Helmer is quick to condemn Nora; although his job at the bank involves borrowing and lending money, he does not want a debt\n<ul>\n<li>This brings out the irony and the hypocrisy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Home</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora’s once home in Act 1 becomes a prison in which she feels she has been trapped and restricted [find quote] in Act 3, so she decided to leave</li>\n<li>Nora is called skylark, squirrel, songbird, all of which are wild creatures\n<ul>\n<li>This can be linked to the fact that the house is a cage for Nora, and it is also shown as she is not even given access to her own house (see above)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Language and style</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Helmer always refers to Nora by a nickname or patronizing adjective such as “little”, followed by “lark”, “songbird”, “squirrel”, and he often uses the possessive pronoun “my”</li>\n<li>Nora has many soliloquies throughout the play\n<ul>\n<li>For example, at the end of Act 2, Nora says to herself: “Five o'clock. Seven hours until midnight; and then four-and-twenty hours until the next midnight. Then the Tarantella will be over. Twenty-four and seven? Thirty-one hours to live.”</li>\n<li>The bird names also depict the weakness of Nora\n<ul>\n<li>Torvald saw this as a way to control her, by making her weaker than she already is</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Structure</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The play follows the structure of a <strong>well-made play</strong>: the exposition sets up the situation through the conversations, and the audience are informed with everything they know to understand what has already happened</li>\n<li>We are also aware that the situation is pressing as Nora is in crisis, and Act 1 ends on a note of high suspense and drama with Krogstad's demand</li>\n<li>In Act 2, we see Nora struggle to find a way out of the situation: first she tries to change Helmer’s mind, then she tries to act Dr. Rank for help, then when all the solutions change, Krogstad changes the demands by making them more serious</li>\n<li>Nora’s dissertation, using her tarantella to postpone the inevitable creates a high dramatic impact</li>\n<li>In Act 3, the suspense is developed further by Ibsen creating possible resolution of the letter being destroyed. More suspense is also created as Dr Rank delays Helmer’s reading of the letter</li>\n<li>The play ends with the dramatic confrontation of Nora and Helmer. Nora’s leaving at that time allows the play to end dramatically\n<ul>\n<li>Had she taken time to decide, all the dramatic impact would have been lost</li>\n<li>Furthermore, she also left at that moment to ensure that the play has unity of time</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The play ends in Christmas with “greatest miracle of all”, which is a possible redemption for Torvald as he seems to have understood the role of Nora in his live as a lover</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quotes</h1>\n<h2>Act 1</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>‘A Room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not <strong>extravagantly</strong>’\n<ul>\n<li>Provides evidence to the lifestyle and setting of the typical family of the hardworking and successful middle class</li>\n<li>Realistic setting, reflecting the typical upper middle class household at the time</li>\n<li>Creates a universal appeal as well</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nora: “We have not needed to economize”; “… earn <strong>lots and lots</strong> of money”\n<ul>\n<li>Repetition shows pride of middle class in money earned</li>\n<li>Elite part of the society</li>\n<li>It also shows that she is naïve in terms of money, but we later see that she has been saving for quite a while\n<ul>\n<li>She is quite excited as she is almost done paying off her debt</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nora: “I even hinted that he might raise a loan.

She was deprived of speech and action, and hence decided to leave Torvald. When the forgery was revealed, she was made aware that her relationship with her husband was not mutual. She also found an imbalance in power distribution between her husband and her as Torvald was the dominant one. She made nothing out of her life as she had been living under the shadow of other men (Torvald and her father: she says she has “been greatly wronged, Torvald––first by papa and then by you”). She decides to leave the Helmer household and experience the world for herself</li>\n<li>Essentially, she wants to discover who she really is, she wants to educate herself\n<ul>\n<li>She is willing to break her marriage in doing so, demonstrating that she has agency.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nora’s independent nature is in direct contrast with the tyrannical authority of Torvald\n<ul>\n<li>They both are not truthful to each other</li>\n<li>When Torvald is proved to be disloyal and ungrateful, she leaves in order to find a better life for herself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Through the course of the play, Nora grows, and reveals all the flaws in her relationship with Torvald; she exposes him</li>\n<li>Her development and transformation as a women leads to her emancipation</li>\n<li><strong>However</strong>, she is going back to her father’s place to inherit all of his wealth, so she really isn't doing anything other than leaving him\n<ul>\n<li>She is still going to be protected with her father’s house and saving, so it is questionable whether she is going to make a life for herself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Self-awakening</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nora's illusions about her family life are shattered by Helmer’s selfish and insensitive reaction to the news of Nora’s forgery: “What a horrible awakening! All these eight years--she who was my joy and pride--a hypocrite, a liar--worse, worse--a criminal!”\n<ul>\n<li>Helmer’s outburst grows her self-awakening, and Nora is finally able to see the truth in Helmer's character</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Communication</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The play begins with superficial communications and dialogs: Torvald calls Nora his “little lark” and a “featherhead”\n<ul>\n<li>Nora exhibits a sense of false childishness in her actions such as “turning around quickly” and getting excited at the mention of money; she is also “playing with his coat buttons”</li>\n<li>Torvald also seems to be close to Nora (false sense of closeness) with actions such as “taking her playfully by the ear” and “wagging his finger at her”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>These are all non-verbal communications, but they do not give a correct idea of their relationship</li>\n<li>Later, we see Nora speaking to other characters such as Kristine and Krogstad more seriously\n<ul>\n<li>She divulges her secrets to Mrs Linde</li>\n<li>She appears more <strong>familiar</strong> and <strong>relaxed</strong> with Dr Rank</li>\n<li>She says “Well, I’m damned” in front of them, something she would never say in front of Torvald</li>\n<li>This reinforces the difference in her relationship with Torvald and Dr Rank/Kristine</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Her conversation with Krogstad is also quite different\n<ul>\n<li>She is calm, composed, and quite serious, showing her ability to achieve a <strong>serious conversation</strong></li>\n<li>She also shows <strong>confidence</strong> as she says that “one has a tiny little bit of influence”</li>\n<li>She does not speak seriously in front to Torvald, apart from the end of the play</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The lack of communication led to the ending of the relationship\n<ul>\n<li>Torvald was unable to understand Nora due to their poor

in Jamaica \n*   Victorian\n*   Literature is response to society of the time time \n\n\n## Jean Rhys (author)\n\n\n\n*   Struggled with being an actor as she was ostracized for her Caribbean heritage and accent, and eventually taken out from school\n*   She became a writer during the “first-wave” feminism period\n\n\n## _Jane Eyre_\n\n\n\n*   This was one of the earliest **feminist **books\n    *   It had to be published under a male pseudonym for that reason\n*   The story follows closely the life of the author, Charlotte Bronte\n*   Wide Sargasso Sea is based on this book\n    *   The author of Wide Sargasso Sea felt that Bertha (Antoinette in Wide Sargasso Sea) was not portrayed in the best way possible\n*   The symbol of the **fire** is there in both books; it is a symbol of freedom\n    *   In Jane Eyre, Bertha commits suicide with fire\n    *   The symbol fire connects the two books, but the differences in perspectives and the husband unnamed keeps the two books apart and makes Wide Sargasso Sea its own story by giving Antoinette and identity (which was destroyed by the end)\n\n\n## SIgnificance of the title\n\n\n\n*   The **sea** is a symbol to **isolation** referring to Antoinette\n*   It is a sea which is in between many others, and from the outside, they all look the same, almost indistinguishable\n    *   However, Antoinette’s problems, although they might look common, are in fact very destructive\n    *   Not many people understood her problems\n*   This is similar to Antoinette, most people think she has the same problems as everyone else, but her problems are more important: also, from the outside her problems really cannot be seen, only when we zoom in we can see them\n*   The sea is also covered in seaweed and is unusually calm in the Bermuda triangle\n    *   Covered in seaweed shows the concealment, how her feelings were quite literally locked up (because of neglect by her mother)\n    *   Bermuda triangle is a place of conflict as it was believed to be a place of destruction\n*   The fact that it is “Wide” shows the big gap between the two ways of life of the colonizers and the creoles\n    *   Antoinette is figuratively in between Jamaica and England\n    *   She is neither colonial nor Jamaican, she is a white creole\n*   Although Antonette marries a colonizer, there is a difference in perspectives, priorities are too wide open and different, and there is not actual union between them\n    *   Antoinette’s husband is english while Antoinette is a woman whose identity is framed by her creole nature, and her ways are different from his, and so she was not accepted by locals\n    *   So the “**wide**” sea also represents a physical and geographical separation\n\n\n# Narrators\n\n\n\n*   The novel follows a complicated narrative strategy with **multiple perspectives**\n    *   If we only saw Antoinette’s perspective, we will see her as a **biased** and **unreliable narrator**\n    *   However, we see a more **holistic view** of her and how she has been affected through the different perspectives, which bring out the different facets of her character\n*   This comes in contrast to the single narrative in _Jane Eyre_; _Wide Sargasso Sea_ is in **response** to that book\n    *   _Wide Sargasso Sea_ provides an explanation for why the madwoman exists in the first place\n    *   In _Jane Eyre_, there is only one narrative account in her name, and although she was marginalized for being poor, she didn't suffer from the racial implications\n    *   For her, the madwoman is just crazy, and she doesn’t go into details to why she is mad\n        *   To JE, the madwoman (Antoinette) is a villain in her happiness\n        *   So JR provides multiple reasons why the “madwomen” even exists, and why she is locked up\n\n\n## Part 1: Antoinette\n\n\n\n*   In Jane Eyre, Bertha Mason’s story is told from the perspective of the narrator, Jane Eyre, who views her as the ‘madwomen’\n*   In this novel, she gets to voice her own experience\n*   In the story, we see her change from child to adolescent\n\n\n### Unreliable narrator \n\n\n\n*   The narration makes the readers feel “closer” to the storyteller as she expressed her inner thoughts, feelings, and also dreams however this makes us as the readers less critical and blind to her faults as it is easier to sympathize for her\n*   Her story is full of gaps and silence, and also secrets\n    *   There are certain parts of the story she chooses not to disclose\n\n\n### Stream of consciousness\n\n\n\n*   Allows the mingling of a child’s perspective to the older narrator's memories\n*   As she watches Pierre sleep, she reflects on Mr Mason’s plans, the future, and the bamboos\n*   All these descriptions come in sharp contrast to the events yet to come\n*   At the beginning, most of the events happen in order but later, it is left to the readers understand as if they are a part of the story\n*   Stream of consciousness also reflects on her uncertainties: this is seen through her lack of traditional sentence structures, and lack of formal dialogues\n    *   Her thoughts are **disjointed** as there are gaps in understanding and narration\n*   She is only recollecting various disconnected thoughts, and sharing her personal thoughts: this gives the reader a glimpse into her mind as she does not share everything\n*   There are many gaps in the narrative (makes her an **unreliable narrator**)\n    *   One gap was after the burning down of the Coulibri\n        *   The gap shows that she feels shocked and is in a state of bewilderment or fear\n    *   There was a minor gap after Annett asks her whose dress she was wearing\n\n\n## Part 2: Antoinette’s husband\n\n\n\n*   Her husband also receives his own point of view and in the story this allows for\n    *   Different points of view on his experienced and relathips offered to readers\n    *   Readers to feel closer to his experience, and not only Antoinette’s\n*   Similar to Antoinette, he also has dislocated experienced of\n    *   New cultural experienced\n    *   Intense sensual effects of the world\n    *   Sexual passion\n    *   Memory and relations with family\n*   JR uses a range of narrative techniques for representing the confused responses to the world and people around him\n*   His first person narrative is manipulated to reveal is precarious sense of his own identity\n*   The setting is **overwhelming** to him, and he feels disconnected\n\n\n### Stream of consciousness\n\n\n\n*   His stream of consciousness makes the novel **less** **biased**, and it introduces the idea of Antoinette’s voice being **muted**, which is further emphasized by the setting change (England, a place Antoinette doesn't feel comfortable in)\n*   There are often differences in what he things and what he says\n*   He has many cultural confusions\n*   He does not understand the colonizers\n\n\n### Daniel cosway\n\n\n\n*   He provides many of the details Antoinette never told Rochester\n*   However, he does not mention the fire at the Coulibri that lead to Annette's grief and hence madness\n*   He is therefore an **unreliable narrator** \n\n\n## Part 3: Grace Poole and Antoinette\n\n\n\n*   The first italicized part is by Grace Poole, Antoinette’s jailer\n*   The second part is narrated by Antoinette, who is now the “madwoman in the attic”\n*   She employs **stream of consciousness** through inner monologue\n\n\n### Other\n\n\n\n*   Other characters are also given their own stories, although not through first-person narratives\n*   We only hear their voice through dialogs, letters\n\n\n### Annette\n\n\n\n*   We get Antoinette’s memories of her, her dialogs reported by Antoinette, gossip and comments of servants and other family members, and information given to Rochester by Daniel Cosway And Christophine\n*   Her descriptions can be contradictory as Antoinette is an **unreliable narrator**\n*   Antoinette doesn't describe her mother’s decline until she is forced to explain her family history to Rochester in Part 2\n    *   This also shows that they were never close (expanded below)\n\n\n### Aunt Cora and Mr Mason\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette’s memories, speech and dialog, gossip\n*   We also get conflicted opinions of them\n\n\n### White community\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette’s speech often slips into recounting local white gossip about her family\n*   This method of narration ensures that the voice remains hers, but also reveals the values and attitudes of the white community to which she belongs\n\n\n### Christophine\n\nHer character is constructed from\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette’s first person narrative: her importance as an influence is demonstrated by the amount of attention she is given in Antoinette’s memories\n    *   Her appearance, manner, and personality are carefully described early in Part 1.\n*   Gossip and fragments of dialog retold by Antoinette reveal the attitudes of other people\n*   Rochester’s POV: he initially sees her as a servant, but he ends up treating her with hostility once he suspects her of using obeah practices on him\n    *   Although the part is narrated by Rochester, she is given her own voice by inserting sections of dialog, in which she confronts Rochester in a very dramatic way.\n*   Letter from Mr Frazer to Rochester: we see an opinion on her held by the judicial element within the white community\n\n\n### Daniel Cosway\n\nHe is represented within Rochester's first person narration\n\n\n\n*   Letters; he sends two letters to Rochester in which he presents his perspective on Antoinette’s family background, which Fuels Rochester's suspensions about insanity\n*   Dialog: his speech is reported by Rochester\n    *   He can command in different styles of speech with rhetorical and biblical resonances\n    *   He modulates into more natural styles of speech later\n    *   However, his dialog is presented by Rochester, and is therefore colored by his perspective.\n*   He is also an **unreliable narrator**\n\n\n### Black servants and the blacks\n\n\n\n*   Mainly reported through speech and dialog in Antoinette’s narration\n*   The wider black community is notably silent in the novel\n\n\n# Structure\n\n\n\n*   There are two main narrators: **Antoinette’s husband** (unnamed) and **Antoinette**, creating a duality of antagonist and protagonist: this creates dichotomy as both are protagonists during the time they narrate the story\n*   This dichotomy creates a **contrast** in personality, themes, and cultures\n\n\n## Conflict of cultures and characters\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette is part of the West Indies culture while Rochester comes from a patriarchal, colonial power\n*   We see the differences in their ideologies: Antoinette likes nature and prefers to be in the garden while Rochester says: “I hated the mountains and the hills, the rivers and the rain. I hated the sunsets of whatever colour, I hated its beauty and it’s magic and the secret I would never know.” Whatever Antoinette describes evokes sympathy and emotion, while Rochester finds the sun and vibrant colors overwhelming: he does not understand interrelations of black and white\n\n\n## Contrast of themes\n\n\n\n*   Need to finish\n\n\n## Why is the book divided into different parts?\n\n\n\n*   To show the flow of time: from childhood, to adolescence, and then a sudden shift to marriage\n*   To show a shift in her mental status\n    *   To show that she tries to find security, but fails to do so\n        *   In Part 2, she tries to find security, but fails to do so\n\n\n### Sympathies\n\n\n\n*   In Part 1, we are sympathetic to Antoinette\n*   In Part 2, we are still sympathetic towards her\n    *   But we get to know her story through her husband, so it is counter-intuitive that we do not sympathize for the narrator\n    *   Although we see all his thoughts and motives, we don't sympathize for him\n    *   Even after known that he a victim of parental influence and manipulation (forced marriage), we don't sympathize for him\n\n\n# Part 1\n\n\n\n*   Narrated by Antoinette; she describes her childhood\n*   There is little flow in the stories with many skips between events as she recollects; one event does not lead to another\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n## Characters\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette\n    *   Her childhood experiences have shaped her character: she receives no comfort or love from her mother, and is **mocked in the society for her origins**, something she cannot control\n        *   She is constantly compared to her mother too (in a bad way), which is, again, something which is out of reach: “Look the crazy girl, you like your mother … She have eyes like zombi and you have eyes like zombi too”\n        *   This also foreshadows that she will end up like her mother\n        *   It also shows that others don't see her as a human being because she is of a different race.\n    *   Her one true friend or solace she found ended up joining the society in mocking her after stealing from her\n        *   This, in a way, caused her to be determined to be away from people, as she was neglected, and Tia betrayed her\n        *   We found out early on that her mother was not fond of her as she ignored her and seldom talked to her, so Antoinette gradually started to avoid people\n    *   Similar to the Garden (symbol), she was **left (neglected) to grow wild**, with no care or guidance\n        *   She was rejected by her mother\n        *   She also states that the company of the grasses was “better, better than people” – it is clear that she was **neglected** as a child\n    *   After the remarriage, she finds her own home **alienating** as she has a new fear of Christophine and her practices of Obeah, although she grew up trusting her\n        *   This fear is based off of gossip she hears in the wedding, and she is struggling to determine what is true\n        *   We feel sympathetic towards her as she feels unsafe in her own home\n    *   After her dress is stolen by Tia, Christophine argues with Annette about how she doesn't have any more dresses: “She run wild, she grow up worthless. And nobody care”\n    *   She is highly emotional and easily feels afraid and hatred, but learns to conceal it after numerous traumatic incidents in her life\n        *   She was forced to conceal her fears and emotions as she was neglected\n    *   She often decides not to talk about certain ideas: she decides not to verbalize certain things in the hope that they are not true\n        *   When the horse died, and when they became “marooned”, she did not tell anyone in the hope that it was not true\n        *   Also, when Mr Mason mentions a suitor, she gets a feeling of insecurity as she will lose her freedom, but she decides to ignore it in the hope that ignoring it will make it disappear\n            *   she understands the **suffocating** truths of marriage, as she has seen them in her mother\n2. Annette\n    *   Antoinette spends most of her early narration describing her mother, and see her progression from a beautiful Creole women who is ostracized by the society to a quite “thin” women who has lost any hope to live\n    *   She finally descends to madness after the fire, and learning that Pierre is dead; she loses all hopes and fears and to her death is the best way out\n        *   She has become disconnected from herself and her emotions as she has lost everything: her husband, her status (after the Emancipation act), and her son, so she chooses her ignore her family and try to escape it. \n    *   We see her signs of instability when she “speaks aloud to herself”, although the arrival of the Luttrell's gives her a new hope\n    *   She is never able to reconnect with Antoinette and wants to leave the past behind\n    *   The fact that her death/funeral is not described in detail shows the distance between Antoinette and Annette\n        *   We actually only understands what happens to the mother when she described it to Rochester; this shows the disconnect between Antoinette and her mother\n        *   Information about her that is unrevealed comes to readers through gossip, such as her death\n        *   This shows that Antoinette thought that it wasn't important anymore as she neglected her so much during childhood – their disconnect is clear\n    *   She foreshadows her daughter’s future as she goes insane as a result of what her husband did\n        *   The similarity between their names also foreshadows that they will have similar lives.\n    *   We later learn in Part 2 that she was sexualy abused by the caretakesr, but Antoinette was unable to mention it because of the trauma she was going through\t\n        *   She also refused to describe it in the hopes that it did not actually happen\n        *   The caretakers were black, and shows a role reversal as usually the white slave owners would force sexual relationships with the black slaves before emancipation\n3. Christophine\n    *   She is the one person who stands by Antoinette’s side, and she teaches her the importance of her Creole heritage and to be proud of it through her songs\n    *   She herself expresses her heritage boldy through the way she dresses, but still tries to fit in by maintaining her accent\n    *   She is feared by the locals as she practises obeah\n    *   “She was your father's wedding present”: she was a freed slave, and she shows loyalty to Annette and her family and does not abandon them\n    *   She is very close to Anette, she even says “Some people say/think [Annette] crazy” when Annette does not understand how poor they are\n        *   This also suggests the intimacy of their relationship\n    *   After the coulibri is renovated, Antoinette has a new fear of her due to obeah\n        *   Because of this and the new servants combined with her neglecting mother, she finds her new home very alienating.\n4. Tia\n    *   She is the representative of the society to Antoinette\n    *   Before making friends with Antoinette, she insulted her\n    *   When Antoinette decides to go live with her, Tia throws a rock at her forehead, showing that she was never accepted by her\n    *   She bettered Antoinette in greed for money and through of her as a “white nigger”; she also taunts Antoinette by saying “we ate salt fish”\n        *   She means to say that because Antoinette is so poor, she cannot afford fresh fish\n    *   She could be one of the driving forces in Antoinette’s life because she constantly mentions her name (in dreams and later in the book)\n    *   She stole Antoinette's clothes and hence her identity\n    *   Although they got along, money drew them apart again\n        *   The childish bet and disagreement reflects the socio-economic disparity between the whites and the blacks\n        *   The fact the Tia steals Antoinette’s dress and her money highlights the symbolic significance of appearance and attire in female power and security in the novel.\n5. Mr Mason\n    *   He is a representative of the white slave owners, a wealthy plantation owner\n    *   He portrays the theme of ignorance as he does not take Annette seriously about moving out; he is self-centered as he wants to make more money\n        *   He does not see Annette’s point of view because he does not understand racial relations on the island (similar to Rochester)\n    *   He is a new breed of the white men as he is cunning and bends laws to fit them to his liking: although the Emancipation Act ended the reign of slave owners, neo-colonialism takes place\n    *   Although Annette has no money, he still married her because he found her beautiful, but when he discovers that she is mentally ill, he locks her up in inhuman conditions\n        *   The fact that Annette and Antoinette are similar foreshadows that even Antoinette will end up in similar conditions\n        *   Sending Antoinette to be married can be similar to being locked up as she is sent against her will as she did not get a choice\n        *   In the end, she ended up getting locked up too: both their lives ended in similar ways\n    *   He has a dislike towards Aunt Cora as she did not help their family during the time of need (find page)\n        *   Furthermore, she was a successful woman, and saying that he dislikes her makes him superior as he is a man and hence he holds more power.\n    *   He misunderstands the locals and does not understand how dangerous they can be: “They're too damn lazy to be dangerous”, “They are children––they wouldn't hurt a fly”, “handful of drunken negroes”\n6. Pierre\n    *   He “staggered when he walked and couldn't speak distinctly”; he is mentally disabled \n    *   He is later described as an idiot to Rochester by Daniel Cosway the bastard\n        *   Rochester thought that the disease was genetic when it was not, so he thought Antoinette was also crazy like him\n        *   This can be linked to ADH: Dr. Rank’s diseases\n    *   Annette “changed” after hearing the doctor about Pierre’s conditions, suggesting that it was an incurable disease, that was likely a burden for the family\n7. Mr Luttrell\n    *   Kills his dog and goes to the sea never to come back\n        *   He has no money\n        *   After the Emancipation Act, he had nothing\n        *   He is a white male who was lost\n    *   He was in a state of despair following the Emancipation Act\n    *   His death sets the mood for the rest of the events, the mood of **despair and disillusionment**\n    *   His death gives Antoinette the troubled ideas of freedom\n8. Sandi Cosway\n    *   She is Antoinette’s black cousin: “I knew who he was, his name was Sandi, Alexander Cosway’s son. Once I would have said ‘my cousin Sandi’ but Mr Mason’s lectures had made me shy about my coloured relatives”\n    *   Mr Mason and his Superior Englishman attitude influenced Antoinette with Sandi Cosway\n        *   Antoinette understood that Mr Mason would not accept any friendship/relationship between her and Sandi\n        *   Mr Mason disliked Antoinette’s creole family (including Aunt Cora)\n        *   Mr Mason is also representative of the English society and their mindset, so the difference in skin color is a barrier that keeps the two apart: this social barrier is heavily linked to racial differences, which had heightened during this time period after the Emancipation Act\n\n\n## Themes\n\n\n\n1. Isolation and ostracizing based on races, and racial discrimination; alienation\n    *   Creoles are seen as being in between as they are not black or white, and are therefore not accepted in the society\n    *   Antoinette refers to non-creoles using the word “**they**” showing a disconnect and clear distinction between the two; this word is used quite early on in the novel suggestion animosity between blacks and whites in Jamaica\n    *   The fact that the family had to “[persuade] a Spanish Town doctor to visit” Pierre demonstrates the tension between the whites and blacks\n    *   The racial hierarchy in the 1830s in Jamaica was complex and strained with tensions between whites and creoles\n        *   There was resentment which lead to hatred and violence such as the Cosways being referred to as “**white cockroaches**”, and eventually being driven away from their homes from their former selves\n        *   These dynamics are also complicated by exclusion based on race, geographical origin, appearance, wealth, and status.\n    *   Major characters in the novel are defined by their inclusion or exclusion from cultural groups\n        *   Although Antoinette and the Cosways where white, they were not the dominant group of Jamaica as they were creoles.\n    *   Alienation leads to the characters of the novel being destructive too: Anette, driven by her family’s exclusions from white society, seeks marriage to Mr Mason, and this ultimately leads to the loss of her son and hence her sanity.\n    *   From the beginning, we see that Antoinette’s family is dysfunctional, and she is quite isolated because of this\n    *   The love marriage of Cosway was not happy as he had many bastard children with other women\n2. Internal isolation from family and neglect\n    *   This is one of the most prominent themes in the novel, and highly relates to Antoinette: she was constantly neglected from her mother, whose voice was neglected by Mr Mason\n    *   It was because of neglect that Annette was cast as an outsider, which leads to her mental breakdown\n3. Effect of the Emancipation Act on the society\n    *   The Emancipation Act of 1833 leaves discontent and violence as seen in Mr Luttrell, a white former slave owner, who commited suicide as he was unable to adjust to the new social and economic landscape.\n    *   Although the Emancipation Act freed slaves, slave owners suffered as shown by the Cosway family. For example, at Coulibri, the local population of black former slaves are deeply angry. Antoinette also says “They hated us”. She was also called a “white cockroach, go away, go away. Nobody want you”\n4. Ignorance and money, the reason Mr Mason did not want to leave\n5. Women and power\n    *   Annette wanted to leave the Coulibri, but was unable to as she couldn't convince Mr Mason\n        *   Similar to how the bird’s wings were clipped, she has a lack of independence in the marriage: the bird’s wings are a metaphor for her independence which is being diminished by Mr Mason\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n\n1. The garden\n    *   The garden at the Coulibri is a symbol of life, or eventually Antoinette as it too runs wild because it is uncared for\n    *   Antoinette finds comfort in the moss of the garden and enjoys wondering about the unexplored areas\n        *   She was **forced** to find comfort in the garden because she was **neglected** by annette, her mother.\n    *   Although she finds beauty in the overgrown orchids, she is afraid to go near them\n    *   Different parts of the garden may present her qualities and her desires\n    *   Antoinette described the garden with many bright colors: “green, white, purple”; she loves these colors and mentions them many times, while Rochester dislikes them and prefers brown and white instead\n    *   “Snakey” looking is a biblical allusion to the snake, which is likely overgrown?\n2. Fire\t\n    *   In the novel, fire represents **freedom and rebellion** (Part 1, page 21, 22, and the end of Part 3)\n    *   The ex-slaves set fire to the Coulibri as an act of **defiance** after being free following the Emancipation Act\n    *   “So black and white, they burn the same, eh? (23)”: this, in a way, unites the whites and the blacks\n    *   Furthermore, at the end of the play, it is suggested that Antoinette committed suicide with fire. In Jane Eyre, Antoinette (Bertha) commits suicide with fire, hence it symbolizes her **rebellion** in order to escape her husband\n3. Hair\n    *   It is a symbol of the female characters’ agency and identity\n    *   At the time of the fire, Annette’s mother had disheveled hair, showing that she is not taken seriously and that her identity doesn't mean anything to Mr Mason\n    *   The fact that Antoinette’s hair has been cut without her knowledge foreshadows that she will slowly lose her identity and agency (This is true because her husband gives her a new name, Bertha, hence she loses her identity, and she also loses her freedom and has to follow her husband's orders)\n        *   Her identity is also being lost as she has lost her father and brother, and her mother is soon to die. \n    *   Eventually, Rochester calls her Bertha, which is not her real name\n        *   This is shows that she has lost her identity\n4. Clothes\n    *   Symbolizes wealth, but only temporary in Part 1\n    *   Clothes and money are divided: as Tia steals the dress\n    *   Link to ADH: the **tarantella dress** is symbol/motif and is linked to **objectification** of women\n    *   However, the removal of dresses in ADH heads to empowerment for the women while it is (bad for Antoinette)\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n1. Beginning racism\n    *   It is a powerful opening beginning with racism: “the Jamaican ladies had never approved of my mother” – the beginning shows that they were excluded socially\n        *   Many people had criticized her mother for being a widow\n        *   This shows that in order for women to be successful, they had to have a man as they had a **lack of agency**\n    *   The fallout between Tia and Antoinette was because of a racial tension, and it also foreshadows the relation with her husband\n2. Women and agency\n    *   Women with a husband/partner have a lack of agency when compared to those who decided not to marry\n    *   This is evident in the case of Annette: she married twice and has a lack of agency and ends up being locked up\n3. Antoinette’s many dreams (pages 11 and 34)\n    *   Dreams are prevalent in Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea, in which they give us views of expressed and **unexpressed emotions**, and they **foreshadow** certain events\n    *   Dreams in Wide Sargasso Sea contain **parallel imagery** to the dreams of Jane Eyre; the dreams on Antoinette are **clairvoyant** like Jane’s dreams, which reflect on a part of her consciousness\n    *   In the novel, Antoinette has three dreams which are essentially of the same event, and they give us insight onto Antoinette’s maturing character and provide foreshadow\n    *   The first dream is in her childhood when Tia steals her pennies and dress: “I dreamed that I was walking in the forest. Not alone. Someone who hated me was with me, out of sight. I could hear heavy footsteps coming closer and though I struggled and screamed, I could not move. I woke crying.” \n        *   This reflects on the young Antoinette's **undeveloped sense of self-awareness**\n        *   The fact that it is in the **past tense** suggests that Antoinette is distances from her dream consciousness, and the vagueness of the threat in her dream suggests that she herself does not understand her fears\n        *   “Safe from the strangers”\n            *   Unknown what she is scared of\n            *   Does not understand her fears\n            *   Rudimentary dream which develops later\n    *   Both Antoinette’s and Jane’s dreams are recurring: Antoinette had her “bad dream” again at the age of seventeen when Mr Mason tells her that he is arranging for suitors to visit her\n    *   “Again I have left the house at Coulibri. It is still night and I am walking towards the forest. I am wearing a long dress and thin slippers, so I walk with difficulty, following the man who is with me and holding up the skirt of my dress. It is white and beautiful and I don't wish to get it soiled. I follow him, sick with fear but I make no effort to save myself; if anyone were to try to save me, I would refuse. This must happen. Now we have reached the forest. We are under the tall dark trees and there is no wind. \"Here?\" He turns and looks at me, his face black with hatred, and when I see this I begin to cry. He smiles slyly. \"Not here, not yet,\" he says, and I follow him, weeping. Now I do not try to hold up my dress, it trails in the dirt, my beautiful dress. We are no longer in the forest but in an enclosed garden surrounded by a stone wall and the trees are different trees. I do not know them. There are steps leading upwards. It is too dark to see the wall or the steps, but I know they are there and I think, \"It will be when I go up these steps. At the top.\" I stumble over my dress and cannot get up. I touch a tree and my arms hold on to it. 'Here, here.' But I think I will not go any further. The tree sways and jerks as if it is trying to throw me off. Still I cling and the seconds pass and each one is a thousand years. \"Here, in here,\" a strange voice said, and the tree stopped swaying and jerking. [34]”\n        *   Stream of consciousness\n        *   Unlike the first dream, this second one occurs in the present tense, suggesting that the problems are more [present], and that she has grown closer to her dream consciousness\n        *   Furthermore, the plot of the second dream is more **clear**, suggesting greater **intelligence and perception**, whereas the first one is **vague** with terms such as: “walking in the forest” with “someone who hated me”\n            *   She understands that there is a “man” who is “black with hatred”\n            *   This could show how she is maturing and hence understands her problems much better.\n        *   The fact that she attempts to keep the dress unsoiled demonstrates her concern with maintaining sexual purity\n            *   It also shows that she is submissive towards him, which she is (in the future)\n        *   This dream foreshadows the problems she will soon face with Rochester: the pure dress represents a wedding dress and the man with “hatred” represents Rochester, and her reluctance to join him symbolizes her reluctance to join Rochester\n        *   Later in the book, she blindly listens to Rochester and performs sexual intimacy (she “masochistically and insistently lays herself on [the] sexual altar” and complies to all his orders) and “[makes] no effort to save [herself]”\n        *   “Smile slyly”: Rochester, stays with her just to maintain property and money, shows how detrimental marriage is to her\n        *   She trips on dress and unable to get up = marriage (wedding trap) traps her and is detrimental to her\n4. Antoinette's safety\n    *   She never finds safety: her house on fire, unsafe marriage, improvement in England non-existent\n    *   She was unsafe because she was unloved as a daughter (because of her gender)\n    *   Discrimination also haunts her\n    *   Women could only gain security through marriage or the convent school\n        *   The convent was quite patriarchal, and Antoinette struggled to adjust there\n        *   She struggled to fit as the convert was based off of religion, which is opposed to black magic, which she grew up with Christophine\n        *   Therefore, the convent creates an identity crisis\n        *   Antoinette learns that women must be with men at the convent school, and she is trained to be a good wife: this relates to the theme of **women and freedom** as women had to live their life being in control of men, by learning how to please them\n        *   Antoinette knows that marriage means a loss in freedom as she will be controlled by her husband\n            *   She decides not to talk to anyone about this in the hope that it is not true\n\n\n## Quotes\n\n\n\n1. Garden better, better than people: Antoinette\n    *   She says this after Tia Leaves her\n    *   Link to the \n\n\n# Part 2\n\n\n## Characters\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette\n    *   She feels **isolation** because she cannot connect emotionally to her husband, and also because of **interracial differences** as she belongs to creoles of french\n    *   She is forced to turn to Christophone for protection when she’s scared\n        *   She asks him to make her husband love her using Obeah, but she is unable to (theme of **supernatural**)\n    *   At the end of this Part, she is referred to as a **[Doll](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.9x7rpt4yhono)**\n    *   No one knows why the town is called Massacre and its history, and this foreshadows the **fall of the marriage** and the **loss of identity** of Antoinette\n2. Her husband\n    *   This part is narrated from his **point of view**, and although he is inhuman, his actions are explained by his suffering, confusion and feelings of alienation\n    *   He is also distant from Antoinette and treats her like a stranger and analyzes her appearance critically (in a bad way)\n        *   He also misunderstands her local culture and considers her language inferior\n        *   His detachment from heirs cleaner, so he critically evaluates her without feeling any emotions for her\n    *   It is also implied that he is detached from her own family\n    *   He carelessly crushes the wedding wreaths: this foreshadows that he will treat the marriage carelessly\t\n    *   When he and her try to connect, the differences are made more clear and his only way to understand her is to compare her to an english girl: she ”might have been any pretty English girl”\n    *   Unlike Antoinette, he feels alienated and threatened by landscape and nature.\n    *   There is a clear difference between his and Antoinette’s structure in terms of emotional expression\n        *   He sees Baptiste looking mournful and finds the Caribbean way of displaying emotions as weak and vulnerable as compared to the English way of hiding and concealing emotions.\n    *   Of the wedding, he only remembers the marble and Antoinette’s **cold hands** (“It was cold as ice in the hot sun (47)”), suggesting that he feels no love of feelings/emotions for her at all\n    *   One reason why he is **disoriented** and dislikes Antoinette with passion is because for him, she is emblematic of the Jamaican landscape, which he doesn't not enjoy as he dislikes the landscape and nature, as opposed to Antoinette, who finds comfort in nature.\n    *   After seeing the letter (28), he gets lost in the forest, this can be related to Antoinette's dream\n        *   Unlike Antoinette, he is not well-versed with nature so he gets lost easily\n        *   He also has less of an appeal to other people, so the girl was scared of him, and this is reinforced as he did not even realize/recognize Baptise looking for him, although it could have been because he was quite disoriented\n        *   This comes in stark contrast to Antoinette’s dream at the end of Part 1\n    *   There is sexual tension between him and Amélie, which foreshadows their sexual relationship\n    *   He pities himself, although Antoinette is the bigger victim\n        *   He is able to self-pity as he holds more power in their relationship\n    *   We never see him working; he is living off the money he earned as a slave owner\n    *   He has limited power as compared to other english men as he was the second son\n        *   He had no choice; he was forced to listen to his father\n        *   But he still made his own (bad, incorrect) choices like cheating on Antoinette when he could have been a better husband, so readers do not sympathize for him (even though we see everything from his point of view)\n    *   He wants to care for Antoinette, but decides not to due to his bitter feelings\n        *   He also does not care for the boy who learned English in the hopes of staying with him\n        *   When the boy cries like that, he feels he is crying “for nothing”, reiterating the fact that he shows no remorse\n        *   After a struggle between compassion and bitterness, bitterness has taken over completely\n3. Daniel Cosway\n    *   He is another character similar to Antoinette who has led a life of inherited suffering\n        *   His is likely her half-brother, a result of Cosway and a slave\n    *   While Antoinette is culturally different from everyone else around her, Daniel is racially different as he has a black mother and white father\n    *   Daniel is a bastard son, similar to Antoinette who was rejected as a child by her mother\n    *   Both he and Antoinette share their sense of **isolation, displacement, and anger**\n    *   Letter of page 59: he is spiteful and attacks Antoinette and his and her family by stating how madness runs in the family\t\n        *   There were tensions between emancipated slaves and their owners.\n    *   He wants revenge on Antoinette and the Cosways as his existence was **marginalized**\n        *   He holds them responsible for his situation\n    *   No one is truly sure about his identity and origins\n        *   Even Amélie, who seems to know him is unsure about his real name\n        *   Everyone relies on gossip to know who is truly is\n4. Christophine\n    *   She believes that most women are foolish to rely only on their husbands, so she stays single so that she can stay independent, although she has had three children from different men\n    *   She also has her own money: “I keep my money. I don't give it to no worthless man”\n    *   When Christophine gives Antoinette her inheritance, the wealth now belongs to her husband\n        *   She and Antoinette loses money this way\n        *   She calls Mr Mason “worse than Satan” as he got Antoinette and forced her (sold her) into marrying Rochester\n    *   She is shown to not easily trust people; her distrust is clear\n        *   she does not believe that England exists: “I never see the damn place, how I know?”\n        *   This differentiates her from Antoinette, who relies on trust (she trusts her geography books)\n        *   Christophone treats that place she has never personally experienced with skepticism\n        *   She also does not even trust her own son (Jo-jo) to not leak out what Antoinette and her have been planning: she described him as “Nothing but leaky calabash that boy\"\n    *   She uses obeah to make Rochester love Antoinette again, but ends up fleeing as he knows that she has drugged him\n        *   This gets her in trouble with the law, so she has to leave Antoinette, and cannot help her anymore as she is powerless\n        *   It is Mr Fraser who informs the husband that she is a practitioner of Obeah and considers her dangerous as she has a criminal record\n5. Aunt Cora\n    *   She is shown to be defeated in comparison to Christophine as she “she turned her face to the wall”\n    *   She was unable to help Antoinette escape the control of Mr Mason and Richard Mason, who married her to Rochester to get money\n6. Amélie\n    *   A maid at Granbois who shows no respect for the husband and Antoinette, although she fears Christophone\n    *   She flirtatiously mocks Rochester until he sleeps with her\n    *   She has sex with the husband, and Antoinette is fully aware of it\n        *   Her husband decides to sleep with her just to mess with Antoinette and maker her weaker than she already is\n7. The Young Bull\n    *   His name illustrates his aggressive desire for dominance\n    *   He tries to impress Rochester by showing that he can speak English and demonstrating his knowledge\n\n\n## Themes\n\n\n\n1. Alienation\n    *   Daniel Cosway, a mixed-race illegitimate child of Cosway, wants to gain revenge for everyone marginalizing his existence\n        *   His exclusion from the Cosway family leads to him to write a series of letters to Rochester **maligning** Antoinette and the rest of her family\n    *   These **letters** disturb Rochester and are the **catalyst** for his ultimate distrust and distaste for Antoinette (Link to ADH as paper is [catalyst](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.jx83je1nb652))\n2. Obeah and colonial mindset\n    *   Everyone feared obeah for what it could do\n    *   Antoinette’s husband has a colonial viewpoint, so he distrusted Christophine for her Obeah practices\n    *   Through obeah, Antoinette tries to change her husband\n    *   When the husband knows that he has been manipulated by obeah, he decides to take away Antoinette's **identity** by naming her Bertha\n        *   He attacks her physcologically\n        *   This changing of her name also shows that he holds all the power in the relationship\n        *   It is ironic that an unnamed character is able to strip a named (main) character from her identity so easily; this shows how much power colonial men had (patriarchal society)\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n\n1. Typical white colonists of the time (see Antoinette’s husband remains unnamed in Part 2)\n    *   He is not named, and Rhys generalizes all white colonists to be similar to him\n        *   Rhys wants us to sympathize for Antoinette (even though her husband is the narrator), and she does this by not giving him a name\n    *   Being a colonist, he is a person who ‘extracts what he needs’: for this reason, he disliked nature\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette’s husband remains unnamed\n    *   This is done so that the writer can use his character to represent all typical white colonists – he is symbolic to all of them as he is a perfect example of one\n    *   This is furthered by the fact that he does not work and he only drinks; white colonists would have all the servants do work for them\n    *   Furthermore, the writer only wants to represent the point of view of Antoinette, so giving him a name and hence an identity is difficult and will go against the main point in the novel\n    *   It is deeply **ironic** that the **unnamed** character robbed the main characters of her name and her identity: although he is unnamed, he holds power as he is a man\n    *   He also wants to distance himself from her\n    *   Not giving him a name essentially generalizes him and all other white colonial men\n    *   On the other hand, women are individualized, as Antoinette is given a name and also given more emphasis to as this is a feminist novel\n    *   The story is also mainly through the feminine perspective, and his name is not mentioned so that Antoinette can occupy the center stage\n    *   The fact that he is unnamed also creates a **cold sense of unfamiliarity** which allows to relate with Antoinette as she is also in anew place\n2. The letter from Daniel Cosway\n    *   Antoinette’s husband says that he was expecting the letter, and this shows that he never truly loved her: “I felt no surprise. It was as if I’d expected it, been waiting for it (62)”\n    *   Daniel writes a letter to Rochester stating that he is an illegitimate child of Mr Cosway\n    *   Similar to A Doll’s House, paper is a catalyst\n\n\n# Part 3\n\n\n\n*   Narrated by Grace Poole, a character who gives a **less biased** view of the story\n*   There are shifting perspectives, which allows people to interpret their own view: multidimensional nature of the characters: “there is always another side (82)”\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n\n*   This part is in the POV of Grace Poole\n*   Antoinette is being kept in the attic of her husband’s house against her will with Grace Poole\n*   Later, the narration switches back to Antoinette’s consciousness and Grace Poole tells her that Richard Mason visited, and that Antoinette attacked him with a knife\n\n\n## Characters\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette’s husband (Rochester)\n    *   Rochester sleeps with Amelie as he feels alienated with Antoinnette\n    *   Christiphone uses Obeah to make Rochester desire Antoinette, but it only had little effect\n    *   hough he got sexually attracted to her, he still sleeps with Amelie as he **suspects** Antoinette – he is **vindictive** as he knows he’s been messed with, and he is also very **manipulative**\n    *   We learn that he has been manipulated by his father in marrying Antoinette, he did not have a choice in this decision\n        *   This makes the readers sympathize for him, but his later actions on Antoinette show that he is inhuman\n    *   He is quite critical of Antoinette’s beauty and objectifies her: he breaks down every component of her face and looks at her with hatred\n        *   He also says that her beauty is a “trick of the light”, showing that he only finds her beautiful at specific times of the day\n        *   He also feels that she is manipulative, as she used Obeah to make him love her\n2. Antoinette\n    *   She is going crazy, just like her mother, and her death is also foreshadowed by her husband: “I drew the sheet over her gently as if I covered a dead girl”; it also states that he marriage satisfaction is dead\n    *   She is unsure about how much time passes as she is going crazy after being alone\n    *   The fact that she doesn't remember attacking Richard Mason with a knife shows that she is losing consciousness\n        *   She cannot remember her violent actions and believes that she didn't recognize Richard Mason\n        *   She also said that she saw a girl in a white dress and thought it was a ghost; this is most likely Jane Eyre\n    *   The red dress reminds her of the relationship she had with Sandi Cosway\n    *   She drops the red dress\n        *   When it spreads like fire, she is one step closer to what she wishes to do\n        *   The color red symbolizes her passion\n    *   She steals Grace’s keys to explore the house\n    *   She has everything taken away from her\n        *   She cannot even please Rochester as she ever sees him again\n        *   She does not have a mirror to see how she herself looks \n    *   At the end, she has a dream about setting the house to fire, climbing on top, then jumping to her death\n        *   This reminds her of the fire in the Coulibri\n        *   When she wakes up, she decides to act out her dream, although it is unclear\n    *   Dreams: again, the dream foreshadows what will truly happened\n3. Grace Poole\n    *   She narrates the first part of Part 3\n        *   She seems to be an **unreliable narrator** as she gossips\n    *   She is paid twice as much as any other servant to keep quiet about the “madwoman in the attic”, although she is uncomfortable about Antoinette’s conditions\n        *   However, she often falls asleep, allowing Antoinette to take her keys and roam around the house\n    *   She was also in Jane Eyre\n    *   She says: “the world outside…can be a black and cruel world to a woman”; where **black** is a reference to one of Antoinette's dreams, where she was being chased by a man “black with hatred”\n    *   Unlike Christophine, she only takes care of her for money; she subdied her for money\n        *   Christophine, on the other hand was more concerned for Antoinette; she awsa s supporting mother figure for her\n\n\n## Themes\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n\n1. Fire\n    *   When Grace Poole lit a fire, Antoinette admires its beauty and wonders why she was locked in the attic\n        *   At this point, her narration is hazy and she only observes things that happen around her\n    *   Fire is both destructive and redemptive in the novel\n        *   In both cases, it was used to rebel too: first the slaves rebelled against the Cosway family, then Antoinette rebelled against her husband\n    *   Antoinette’s dream was in a way **foreshadowed** by** Coco flying into the flames**\n        *   The wings area symbol of **independence**, and Antoinette did not have any, so she thought that she was better off dead\n        *   Through suicide she gains freedom and betrays Rochester\n2. Red dress\n    *   The red dress triggers many memories (that were left out earlier in the narration) for Antoinette\n        *   For example, her and Sandi’s relation: he also asked her if she wanted to elope and they often kissed\n        *   She does not share this with Grace Poole, reinforcing her distrust of her\n    *   Her red dress comes in stark contrast to the white dress of the white girl she saw (Jane Eyre)\n        *   The dress symbolizes passion\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n1. Similarities between Rochester and Antoinette\n    *   Both are delusional and both were neglected at childhood and then forced to marry; both like rum – it allowed them to escape reality\n    *   They were alcoholics as they did not have work at the plantation because no more slaves, so the only thing to do was drink. This created a state of disarray as the transition from slaves to no slaves was very abrupt\n2. Marriage\n    *   There is some hypocrisy: Rochester received money as a dowry in marrying Antoinette, while Amelie paid Rochester money to have sex with him\n    *   The first one is socially acceptable and the other one is socially unacceptable\n3. Names\n    *   After starting at the tapestry hanging on her wall for a long time, she starts seeing her mother, but doesn't tell Grace about it – she is hallucinating and slowly losing her sanity\n        *   She feels disconnected from her identity\n    *   She also notes that “Grace” does not fit Grace Poole, and seems to have a distrust of her\n4. Antoinette’s death; shouting Tia\n    *   When she jumps into the fire, she decides to shout Tia’s name\n\n\n# More notes\n\n\n## Slavery\n\n\n\n*   In Wide Sargasso Sea, the Emancipation act led to the freedom of the slaves\n*   But slavery also exists between husband and wife, as seen by Antoinette and her husband: this is a different type of slavery\n*   Slavery also extends to post-colonial slavery\n    *   Antoinette’s husband tells Christophe that he will turn her for her Obeah practices\n    *   This suppression continues even after the Emancipation act\n\n\n## Burning of houses\n\n\n\n*   Two houses burned down in the novel\n*   The burning of the houses is a symbolism and parallelism\n    *   First the slaves burned the house to avenge themselves\n    *   It is implied that Antoinette, at the end of the novel, burns her husband’s house down to escape\n        *   She killed herself in the process, so she lays down her life in the hope to be free and destroy her husband\n        *   She shows her agency by doing this\n\n\n## Antoinette’s agency\n\n\n\n*   She tries to \n\n\n# Themes\n\n\n## Identity\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette does not fit in anywhere as she is a creole English\n    *   She is neither Jamaican nor from England, so she feels like an outsider, and others also treat her like one\n*   Chrisophone, on the other hand is portrayed as Caribbean, while Antoinette does not fit it anywhere\n\n\n## Slavery and freedom\n\n\n\n*   Conflict is created between the newly emancipated slaves and their owners\n    *   Their interactions lead to the bringdown of the Coulibri\n\n\n## Power\n\n\n\n*   Chrisotophone has access to Obeah\n*   Rochester has the power to change Antoinette’s name\n\n\n## Money\n\n\n## Women and power\n\n\n\n*   The female characters in Wide Sargasso Sea were confronted by societal forces that prevent them from acting and sustaining themselves\n*   The only socially acceptable ways for a woman to attain security were marriage and entering the convert \n*   In Annette’s case, the marriage destroyed not only hers, but also her children’s lives\n    *   Alexander Cosway, the first husband had many affairs publicly, and therefore many bastard children\n    *   When he died, he left the family destitute\n    *   He ignored her pleas to move out, which ended up killing Pierre and causing her to descend to madness\n    *   Antoinette was forced to marry Rochester by Mr Mason for money: this marriage was only done for financial benefit to Rochester and Mr Mason; he essentially sold her\n*   Rochester sleeps with Amelie, without making any effort to hide it from Antoinette, while still on their honeymoon\n*   The female characters who embody strength and agency are those who decide to remain outside the control of men/husbands\n    *   One example is Christophone\n        *   Christophine was respected in her community for her expertise in Obeah, and Antoinette also depended on her\n        *   She states that “Women must have spunks to live in this wicked world”, and ““All women, all colours, nothing but fools. Three children I have. One living in this world, each one a different father, but no husband, I thank my God. I keep my money. I don’t give it to no worthless man”\n    *   Auto Cora is a widow who does not remarry\n        *   She was relatively stable, and able to control her health and movements\n        *   She also promises safety for Antoinette \n*   Amelie is a minor character who also demonstrates that power can be with those outside traditional marriages\n    *   She manipulates sex to exercise to gain control over her employers, so she sleeps with and receives money from Rochester\n    *   She also says that she plans to move to Rio to continue the same tactic: “She wanted to go to Rio. There were rich men in Rio”\n\n\n## Horror novel\n\n\n\n*   Wide Sargasso Sea explores ideas of domestic abuse and cruelty\n*   For example, rochester renames Antoinette\n    *   Antoinette first has a name, then it is taken from her. This shows how she lost her identity to the unnamed character\n    *   He renames her Bertha, just like a slave-owner renaming its possessions, in order to assert his dominance, and distance himesend from her heritage and alleged madness\n    *   He has also taken her money, property, sense of security, emotional happiness, secual dignity, and finally her name\n    *   He calls her laugh a “crazy laugh”, which justifies in his delusion, his abuse of her\n    *   He also pretends to believe that she has harmed him: “You deceived me, betrayed me”\n    *   He also reduced her to a “doll” and a “marionette”, a plaything and object to be manipulated\n    *   At the end, he describes her as if he is on the perpetrator of her destruction: “only a ghost … nothing left but hopelessness”\n    *   He also makes sure he can never get away from her: “She’s mad but mine … my lunatic. My mad girl”",html:"<ul>\n<li>Set in the 1830s, after the Emancipation Act</li>\n<li>Set in Jamaica</li>\n<li>Victorian</li>\n<li>Literature is response to society of the time

the two books apart and makes Wide Sargasso Sea its own story by giving Antoinette and identity (which was destroyed by the end)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>SIgnificance of the title</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>sea</strong> is a symbol to <strong>isolation</strong> referring to Antoinette</li>\n<li>It is a sea which is in between many others, and from the outside, they all look the same, almost indistinguishable\n<ul>\n<li>However, Antoinette’s problems, although they might look common, are in fact very destructive</li>\n<li>Not many people understood her problems</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This is similar to Antoinette, most people think she has the same problems as everyone else, but her problems are more important: also, from the outside her problems really cannot be seen, only when we zoom in we can see them</li>\n<li>The sea is also covered in seaweed and is unusually calm in the Bermuda triangle\n<ul>\n<li>Covered in seaweed shows the

too wide open and different, and there is not actual union between them\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s husband is english while Antoinette is a woman whose identity is framed by her creole nature, and her ways are different from his, and so she was not accepted by locals</li>\n<li>So the “<strong>wide</strong>” sea also represents a physical and geographical separation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Narrators</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The novel follows a complicated narrative strategy with <strong>multiple perspectives</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If we only saw Antoinette’s perspective, we will see her as a <strong>biased</strong> and <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n<li>However, we see a more <strong>holistic view</strong> of her and how she has been affected through the different perspectives, which bring out the different facets of her character</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This comes in contrast to the single narrative in <em>Jane Eyre</em>; <em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em> is in <strong>response</strong> to that book\n<ul>\n<li><em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em> provides an explanation for why the madwoman exists in the first place</li>\n<li>In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, there is only one narrative account in her name, and although she was marginalized for being poor, she didn't suffer from the racial implications</li>\n<li>For her, the madwoman is just crazy, and she doesn’t go into details to why she is mad\n<ul>\n<li>To JE, the madwoman (Antoinette) is a villain in her happiness</li>\n<li>So JR provides multiple reasons why the “madwomen” even exists, and why she is locked up</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part 1: Antoinette</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In Jane Eyre, Bertha Mason’s story is told from the perspective of the narrator, Jane Eyre, who views her as the ‘madwomen’</li>\n<li>In this novel, she gets to voice her own experience</li>\n<li>In the story, we see her change from child to adolescent</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unreliable narrator</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The narration makes the readers feel “closer” to the storyteller as she expressed her inner thoughts, feelings, and also dreams however this makes us as the readers less critical and blind to her faults as it is easier to sympathize for her</li>\n<li>Her story is full of gaps and silence, and also secrets\n<ul>\n<li>There are certain parts of the story she chooses not to disclose</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stream of consciousness</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows the mingling of a child’s perspective to the older narrator's memories</li>\n<li>As she watches Pierre sleep, she reflects on Mr Mason’s plans, the future, and the bamboos</li>\n<li>All these descriptions come in sharp contrast to the events yet to come</li>\n<li>At the beginning, most of the events happen in order but later, it is left to the readers understand as if they are a part of the story</li>\n<li>Stream of consciousness also reflects on her uncertainties: this is seen through her lack of traditional sentence structures, and lack of formal dialogues\n<ul>\n<li>Her thoughts are <strong>disjointed</strong> as there are gaps in understanding and narration</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She is only recollecting various disconnected thoughts, and sharing her personal thoughts: this gives the reader a glimpse into her mind as she does not share everything</li>\n<li>There are many gaps in the narrative (makes her an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong>)\n<ul>\n<li>One gap was after the burning down of the Coulibri\n<ul>\n<li>The gap shows that she feels shocked and is in a state of bewilderment or fear</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There was a minor gap after Annett asks her whose dress she was wearing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part 2: Antoinette’s husband</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Her husband also receives his own point of view and in the story this allows for\n<ul>\n<li>Different points of view on his experienced and relathips offered to readers</li>\n<li>Readers to feel closer to his experience, and not only Antoinette’s</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Similar to Antoinette, he also has dislocated experienced of\n<ul>\n<li>New cultural experienced</li>\n<li>Intense sensual effects of the world</li>\n<li>Sexual passion</li>\n<li>Memory and relations with family</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>JR uses a range of narrative techniques for representing the confused responses to the world and people around him</li>\n<li>His first person narrative is manipulated to reveal is precarious sense of his own identity</li>\n<li>The setting is <strong>overwhelming</strong> to him, and he feels disconnected</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stream of consciousness</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>His stream of consciousness makes the novel <strong>less</strong> <strong>biased</strong>, and it introduces the idea of Antoinette’s voice being <strong>muted</strong>, which is further emphasized by the setting change (England, a place Antoinette doesn't feel comfortable in)</li>\n<li>There are often differences in what he things and what he says</li>\n<li>He has many cultural confusions</li>\n<li>He does not understand the colonizers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Daniel cosway</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>He provides many of the details Antoinette never told Rochester</li>\n<li>However, he does not mention the fire at the Coulibri that lead to Annette's grief and hence madness</li>\n<li>He is therefore an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part 3: Grace Poole and Antoinette</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The first italicized part is by Grace Poole, Antoinette’s jailer</li>\n<li>The second part is narrated by Antoinette, who is now the “madwoman in the attic”</li>\n<li>She employs <strong>stream of consciousness</strong> through inner monologue</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Other characters are also given their own stories, although not through first-person narratives</li>\n<li>We only hear their voice through dialogs, letters</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Annette</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We get Antoinette’s memories of her, her dialogs reported by Antoinette, gossip and comments of servants and other family members, and information given to Rochester by Daniel Cosway And Christophine</li>\n<li>Her descriptions can be contradictory as Antoinette is an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n<li>Antoinette doesn't describe her mother’s decline until she is forced to explain her family history to Rochester in Part 2\n<ul>\n<li>This also shows that they were never close (expanded below)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Aunt Cora and Mr Mason</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s memories, speech and dialog, gossip</li>\n<li>We also get conflicted opinions of them</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>White community</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s speech often slips into recounting local white gossip about her family</li>\n<li>This method of narration ensures that the voice remains hers, but also reveals the values and attitudes of the white community to which she belongs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Christophine</h3>\n<p>Her character is constructed from</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s first person narrative: her importance as an influence is demonstrated by the amount of attention she is given in Antoinette’s memories\n<ul>\n<li>Her appearance, manner, and personality are carefully described early in Part 1.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gossip and fragments of dialog retold by Antoinette reveal the attitudes of other people</li>\n<li>Rochester’s POV: he initially sees her as a servant, but he ends up treating her with hostility once he suspects her of using obeah practices on him\n<ul>\n<li>Although the part is narrated by Rochester, she is given her own voice by inserting sections of dialog, in which she confronts Rochester in a very dramatic way.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Letter from Mr Frazer to Rochester: we see an opinion on her held by the judicial element within the white community</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Daniel Cosway</h3>\n<p>He is represented within Rochester's first person narration</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Letters; he sends two letters to Rochester in which he presents his perspective on Antoinette’s family background, which Fuels Rochester's suspensions about insanity</li>\n<li>Dialog: his speech is reported by Rochester\n<ul>\n<li>He can command in different styles of speech with rhetorical and biblical resonances</li>\n<li>He modulates into more natural styles of speech later</li>\n<li>However, his dialog is presented by Rochester, and is therefore colored by his perspective.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He is also an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Black servants and the blacks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mainly reported through speech and dialog in Antoinette’s narration</li>\n<li>The wider black community is notably silent in the novel</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Structure</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>There are two main narrators: <strong>Antoinette’s husband</strong> (unnamed) and <strong>Antoinette</strong>, creating a duality of antagonist and protagonist: this creates dichotomy as both are protagonists during the time they narrate the story</li>\n<li>This dichotomy creates a <strong>contrast</strong> in personality, themes, and cultures</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conflict of cultures and characters</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette is part of the West Indies culture while Rochester comes from a patriarchal, colonial power</li>\n<li>We see the differences in their ideologies: Antoinette likes nature and prefers to be in the garden while Rochester says: “I hated the mountains and the hills, the rivers and the rain. I hated the sunsets of whatever colour, I hated its beauty and it’s magic and the secret I would never know.” Whatever Antoinette describes evokes sympathy and emotion, while Rochester finds the sun and vibrant colors overwhelming: he does not understand interrelations of black and white</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contrast of themes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Need to finish</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why is the book divided into different parts?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To show the flow of time: from childhood, to adolescence, and then a sudden shift to marriage</li>\n<li>To show a shift in her mental status\n<ul>\n<li>To show that she tries to find security, but fails to do so\n<ul>\n<li>In Part 2, she tries to find security, but fails to do so</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sympathies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In Part 1, we are sympathetic to Antoinette</li>\n<li>In Part 2, we are still sympathetic towards her\n<ul>\n<li>But we get to know her story through her husband, so it is counter-intuitive that we do not sympathize for the narrator</li>\n<li>Although we see all his thoughts and motives, we don't sympathize for him</li>\n<li>Even after known that he a victim of parental influence and manipulation (forced marriage), we don't sympathize for him</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Part 1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Narrated by Antoinette; she describes her childhood</li>\n<li>There is little flow in the stories with many skips between events as she recollects; one event does not lead to another</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<h2>Characters</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Antoinette\n<ul>\n<li>Her childhood experiences have shaped her character: she receives no comfort or love from her mother, and is <strong>mocked in the society for her origins</strong>, something she cannot control\n<ul>\n<li>She is constantly compared to her mother too (in a bad way), which is, again, something which is out of reach: “Look the crazy girl, you like your mother … She have eyes like zombi and you have eyes like zombi too”</li>\n<li>This also foreshadows that she will end up like her mother</li>\n<li>It also shows that others don't see her as a human being because she is of a different race.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Her one true friend or solace she found ended up joining the society in mocking her after stealing from her\n<ul>\n<li>This, in a way, caused her to be determined to be away from people, as she was neglected, and Tia betrayed her</li>\n<li>We found out early on that her mother was not fond of her as she ignored her and seldom talked to her, so Antoinette gradually started to avoid people</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Similar to the Garden (symbol), she was <strong>left (neglected) to grow wild</strong>, with no care or guidance\n<ul>\n<li>She was rejected by her mother</li>\n<li>She also states that the company of the grasses was “better, better than people” – it is clear that she was <strong>neglected</strong> as a child</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After the remarriage, she finds her own home <strong>alienating</strong> as she has a new fear of Christophine and her practices of Obeah, although she grew up trusting her\n<ul>\n<li>This fear is based off of gossip she hears in the wedding, and she is struggling to determine what is true</li>\n<li>We feel sympathetic towards her as she feels unsafe in her own home</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After her dress is stolen by Tia, Christophine argues with Annette about how she doesn't have any more dresses: “She run wild, she grow up worthless. And nobody care”</li>\n<li>She is highly emotional and easily feels afraid and hatred, but learns to conceal it after numerous traumatic incidents in her life\n<ul>\n<li>She was forced to conceal her fears and emotions as she was neglected</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She often decides not to talk about certain ideas: she decides not to verbalize certain things in the hope that they are not true\n<ul>\n<li>When the horse died, and when they became “marooned”, she did not tell anyone in the hope that it was not true</li>\n<li>Also, when Mr Mason mentions a suitor, she gets a feeling of insecurity as she will lose her freedom, but she decides to ignore it in the hope that ignoring it will make it disappear\n<ul>\n<li>she understands the <strong>suffocating</strong> truths of marriage, as she has seen them in her mother</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Annette\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette spends most of her early narration describing her mother, and see her progression from a beautiful Creole women who is ostracized by the society to a quite “thin” women who has lost any hope to live</li>\n<li>She finally descends to madness after the fire, and learning that Pierre is dead; she loses all hopes and fears and to her death is the best way out\n<ul>\n<li>She has become disconnected from herself and her emotions as she has lost everything: her husband, her status (after the Emancipation act), and her son, so she chooses her ignore her family and try to escape it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We see her signs of instability when she “speaks aloud to herself”, although the arrival of the Luttrell's gives her a new hope</li>\n<li>She is never able to reconnect with Antoinette and wants to leave the past behind</li>\n<li>The fact that her death/funeral is not described in detail shows the distance between Antoinette and Annette\n<ul>\n<li>We actually only understands what happens to the mother when she described it to Rochester; this shows the disconnect between Antoinette and her mother</li>\n<li>Information about her that is unrevealed comes to readers through gossip, such as her death</li>\n<li>This shows that Antoinette thought that it wasn't important anymore as she neglected her so much during childhood – their disconnect is clear</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She foreshadows her daughter’s future as she goes insane as a result of what her husband did\n<ul>\n<li>The similarity between their names also foreshadows that they will have similar lives.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We later learn in Part 2 that she was sexualy abused by the caretakesr, but Antoinette was unable to mention it because of the trauma she was going through\n<ul>\n<li>She also refused to describe it in the hopes that it did not actually happen</li>\n<li>The caretakers were black, and shows a role reversal as usually the white slave owners would force sexual relationships with the black slaves before emancipation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Christophine\n<ul>\n<li>She is the one person who stands by Antoinette’s side, and she teaches her the importance of her Creole heritage and to be proud of it through her songs</li>\n<li>She herself expresses her heritage boldy through the way she dresses, but still tries to fit in by maintaining her accent</li>\n<li>She is feared by the locals as she practises obeah</li>\n<li>“She was your father's wedding present”: she was a freed slave, and she shows loyalty to Annette and her family and does not abandon them</li>\n<li>She is very close to Anette, she even says “Some people say/think [Annette] crazy” when Annette does not understand how poor they are\n<ul>\n<li>This also suggests the intimacy of their relationship</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After the coulibri is renovated, Antoinette has a new fear of her due to obeah\n<ul>\n<li>Because of this and the new servants combined with her neglecting mother, she finds her new home very alienating.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tia\n<ul>\n<li>She is the representative of the society to Antoinette</li>\n<li>Before making friends with Antoinette, she insulted her</li>\n<li>When Antoinette decides to go live with her, Tia throws a rock at her forehead, showing that she was never accepted by her</li>\n<li>She bettered Antoinette in greed for money and through of her as a “white nigger”; she also taunts Antoinette by saying “we ate salt fish”\n<ul>\n<li>She means to say that because Antoinette is so poor, she cannot afford fresh fish</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She could be one of the driving forces in Antoinette’s life because she constantly mentions her name (in dreams and later in the book)</li>\n<li>She stole Antoinette's clothes and hence her identity</li>\n<li>Although they got along, money drew them apart again\n<ul>\n<li>The childish bet and disagreement reflects the socio-economic disparity between the whites and the blacks</li>\n<li>The fact the Tia steals Antoinette’s dress and her money highlights the symbolic significance of appearance and attire in female power and security in the novel.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mr Mason\n<ul>\n<li>He is a representative of the white slave owners, a wealthy plantation owner</li>\n<li>He portrays the theme of ignorance as he does not take Annette seriously about moving out; he is self-centered as he wants to make more money\n<ul>\n<li>He does not see Annette’s point of view because he does not understand racial relations on the island (similar to Rochester)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He is a new breed of the white men as he is cunning and bends laws to fit them to his liking: although the Emancipation Act ended the reign of slave owners, neo-colonialism takes place</li>\n<li>Although Annette has no money, he still married her because he found her beautiful, but when he discovers that she is mentally ill, he locks her up in inhuman conditions\n<ul>\n<li>The fact that Annette and Antoinette are similar foreshadows that even Antoinette will end up in similar conditions</li>\n<li>Sending Antoinette to be married can be similar to being locked up as she is sent against her will as she did not get a choice</li>\n<li>In the end, she ended up getting locked up too: both their lives ended in similar ways</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He has a dislike towards Aunt Cora as she did not help their family during the time of need (find page)\n<ul>\n<li>Furthermore, she was a successful woman, and saying that he dislikes her makes him superior as he is a man and hence he holds more power.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He misunderstands the locals and does not understand how dangerous they can be: “They're too damn lazy to be dangerous”, “They are children––they wouldn't hurt a fly”, “handful of drunken negroes”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Pierre\n<ul>\n<li>He “staggered when he walked and couldn't speak distinctly”; he is mentally disabled</li>\n<li>He is later described as an idiot to Rochester by Daniel Cosway the bastard\n<ul>\n<li>Rochester thought that the disease was genetic when it was not, so he thought Antoinette was also crazy like him</li>\n<li>This can be linked to ADH: Dr. Rank’s diseases</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Annette “changed” after hearing the doctor about Pierre’s conditions, suggesting that it was an incurable disease, that was likely a burden for the family</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mr Luttrell\n<ul>\n<li>Kills his dog and goes to the sea never to come back\n<ul>\n<li>He has no money</li>\n<li>After the Emancipation Act, he had nothing</li>\n<li>He is a white male who was lost</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He was in a state of despair following the Emancipation Act</li>\n<li>His death sets the mood for the rest of the events, the mood of <strong>despair and disillusionment</strong></li>\n<li>His death gives Antoinette the troubled ideas of freedom</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Sandi Cosway\n<ul>\n<li>She is Antoinette’s black cousin: “I knew who he was, his name was Sandi, Alexander Cosway’s son. Once I would have said ‘my cousin Sandi’ but Mr Mason’s lectures had made me shy about my coloured relatives”</li>\n<li>Mr Mason and his Superior Englishman attitude influenced Antoinette with Sandi Cosway\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette understood that Mr Mason would not accept any friendship/relationship between her and Sandi</li>\n<li>Mr Mason disliked Antoinette’s creole family (including Aunt Cora)</li>\n<li>Mr Mason is also representative of the English society and their mindset, so the difference in skin color is a barrier that keeps the two apart: this social barrier is heavily linked to racial differences, which had heightened during this time period after the Emancipation Act</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Themes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Isolation and ostracizing based on races, and racial discrimination; alienation\n<ul>\n<li>Creoles are seen as being in between as they are not black or white, and are therefore not accepted in the society</li>\n<li>Antoinette refers to non-creoles using the word “<strong>they</strong>” showing a disconnect and clear distinction between the two; this word is used quite early on in the novel suggestion animosity between blacks and whites in Jamaica</li>\n<li>The fact that the family had to “[persuade] a Spanish Town doctor to visit” Pierre demonstrates the tension between the whites and blacks</li>\n<li>The racial hierarchy in the 1830s in Jamaica was complex and strained with tensions between whites and creoles\n<ul>\n<li>There was resentment which lead to hatred and violence such as the Cosways being referred to as “<strong>white cockroaches</strong>”, and eventually being driven away from their homes from their former selves</li>\n<li>These dynamics are also complicated by exclusion based on race, geographical origin, appearance, wealth, and status.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Major characters in the novel are defined by their inclusion or exclusion from cultural groups\n<ul>\n<li>Although Antoinette and the Cosways where white, they were not the dominant group of Jamaica as they were creoles.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Alienation leads to the characters of the novel being destructive too: Anette, driven by her family’s exclusions from white society, seeks marriage to Mr Mason, and this ultimately leads to the loss of her son and hence her sanity.</li>\n<li>From the beginning, we see that Antoinette’s family is dysfunctional, and she is quite isolated because of this</li>\n<li>The love marriage of Cosway was not happy as he had many bastard children with other women</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Internal isolation from family and neglect\n<ul>\n<li>This is one of the most prominent themes in the novel, and highly relates to Antoinette: she was constantly neglected from her mother, whose voice was neglected by Mr Mason</li>\n<li>It was because of neglect that Annette was cast as an outsider, which leads to her mental breakdown</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Effect of the Emancipation Act on the society\n<ul>\n<li>The Emancipation Act of 1833 leaves discontent and violence as seen in Mr Luttrell, a white former slave owner, who commited suicide as he was unable to adjust to the new social and economic landscape.</li>\n<li>Although the Emancipation Act freed slaves, slave owners suffered as shown by the Cosway family. For example, at Coulibri, the local population of black former slaves are deeply angry. Antoinette also says “They hated us”. She was also called a “white cockroach, go away, go away. Nobody want you”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ignorance and money, the reason Mr Mason did not want to leave</li>\n<li>Women and power\n<ul>\n<li>Annette wanted to leave the Coulibri, but was unable to as she couldn't convince Mr Mason\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to how the bird’s wings were clipped, she has a lack of independence in the marriage: the bird’s wings are a metaphor for her independence which is being diminished by Mr Mason</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The garden\n<ul>\n<li>The garden at the Coulibri is a symbol of life, or eventually Antoinette as it too runs wild because it is uncared for</li>\n<li>Antoinette finds comfort in the moss of the garden and enjoys wondering about the unexplored areas\n<ul>\n<li>She was <strong>forced</strong> to find comfort in the garden because she was <strong>neglected</strong> by annette, her mother.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Although she finds beauty in the overgrown orchids, she is afraid to go near them</li>\n<li>Different parts of the garden may present her qualities and her desires</li>\n<li>Antoinette described the garden with many bright colors: “green, white, purple”; she loves these colors and mentions them many times, while Rochester dislikes them and prefers brown and white instead</li>\n<li>“Snakey” looking is a biblical allusion to the snake, which is likely overgrown?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fire\n<ul>\n<li>In the novel, fire represents <strong>freedom and rebellion</strong> (Part 1, page 21, 22, and the end of Part 3)</li>\n<li>The ex-slaves set fire to the Coulibri as an act of <strong>defiance</strong> after being free following the Emancipation Act</li>\n<li>“So black and white, they burn the same, eh? (23)”: this, in a way, unites the whites and the blacks</li>\n<li>Furthermore, at the end of the play, it is suggested that Antoinette committed suicide with fire. In Jane Eyre, Antoinette (Bertha) commits suicide with fire, hence it symbolizes her <strong>rebellion</strong> in order to escape her husband</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hair\n<ul>\n<li>It is a symbol of the female characters’ agency and identity</li>\n<li>At the time of the fire, Annette’s mother had disheveled hair, showing that she is not taken seriously and that her identity doesn't mean anything to Mr Mason</li>\n<li>The fact that Antoinette’s hair has been cut without her knowledge foreshadows that she will slowly lose her identity and agency (This is true because her husband gives her a new name, Bertha, hence she loses her identity, and she also loses her freedom and has to follow her husband's orders)\n<ul>\n<li>Her identity is also being lost as she has lost her father and brother, and her mother is soon to die.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Eventually, Rochester calls her Bertha, which is not her real name\n<ul>\n<li>This is shows that she has lost her identity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Clothes\n<ul>\n<li>Symbolizes wealth, but only temporary in Part 1</li>\n<li>Clothes and money are divided: as Tia steals the dress</li>\n<li>Link to ADH: the <strong>tarantella dress</strong> is symbol/motif and is linked to <strong>objectification</strong> of women</li>\n<li>However, the removal of dresses in ADH heads to empowerment for the women while it is (bad for Antoinette)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Beginning racism\n<ul>\n<li>It is a powerful opening beginning with racism: “the Jamaican ladies had never approved of my mother” – the beginning shows that they were excluded socially\n<ul>\n<li>Many people had criticized her mother for being a widow</li>\n<li>This shows that in order for women to be successful, they had to have a man as they had a <strong>lack of agency</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The fallout between Tia and Antoinette was because of a racial tension, and it also foreshadows the relation with her husband</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Women and agency\n<ul>\n<li>Women with a husband/partner have a lack of agency when compared to those who decided not to marry</li>\n<li>This is evident in the case of Annette: she married twice and has a lack of agency and ends up being locked up</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Antoinette’s many dreams (pages 11 and 34)\n<ul>\n<li>Dreams are prevalent in Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea, in which they give us views of expressed and <strong>unexpressed emotions</strong>, and they <strong>foreshadow</strong> certain events</li>\n<li>Dreams in Wide Sargasso Sea contain <strong>parallel imagery</strong> to the dreams of Jane Eyre; the dreams on Antoinette are <strong>clairvoyant</strong> like Jane’s dreams, which reflect on a part of her consciousness</li>\n<li>In the novel, Antoinette has three dreams which are essentially of the same event, and they give us insight onto Antoinette’s maturing character and provide foreshadow</li>\n<li>The first dream is in her childhood when Tia steals her pennies and dress: “I dreamed that I was walking in the forest. Not alone. Someone who hated me was with me, out of sight. I could hear heavy footsteps coming closer and though I struggled and screamed, I could not move. I woke crying.”\n<ul>\n<li>This reflects on the young Antoinette's <strong>undeveloped sense of self-awareness</strong></li>\n<li>The fact that it is in the <strong>past tense</strong> suggests that Antoinette is distances from her dream consciousness, and the vagueness of the threat in her dream suggests that she herself does not understand her fears</li>\n<li>“Safe from the strangers”\n<ul>\n<li>Unknown what she is scared of</li>\n<li>Does not understand her fears</li>\n<li>Rudimentary dream which develops later</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Both Antoinette’s and Jane’s dreams are recurring: Antoinette had her “bad dream” again at the age of seventeen when Mr Mason tells her that he is arranging for suitors to visit her</li>\n<li>“Again I have left the house at Coulibri. It is still night and I am walking towards the forest. I am wearing a long dress and thin slippers, so I walk with difficulty, following the man who is with me and holding up the skirt of my dress. It is white and beautiful and I don't wish to get it soiled. I follow him, sick with fear but I make no effort to save myself; if anyone were to try to save me, I would refuse. This must happen. Now we have reached the forest. We are under the tall dark trees and there is no wind. &quot;Here?&quot; He turns and looks at me, his face black with hatred, and when I see this I begin to cry. He smiles slyly. &quot;Not here, not yet,&quot; he says, and I follow him, weeping. Now I do not try to hold up my dress, it trails in the dirt, my beautiful dress. We are no longer in the forest but in an enclosed garden surrounded by a stone wall and the trees are different trees. I do not know them. There are steps leading upwards. It is too dark to see the wall or the steps, but I know they are there and I think, &quot;It will be when I go up these steps. At the top.&quot; I stumble over my dress and cannot get up. I touch a tree and my arms hold on to it. 'Here, here.' But I think I will not go any further. The tree sways and jerks as if it is trying to throw me off. Still I cling and the seconds pass and each one is a thousand years. &quot;Here, in here,&quot; a strange voice said, and the tree stopped swaying and jerking. [34]”\n<ul>\n<li>Stream of consciousness</li>\n<li>Unlike the first dream, this second one occurs in the present tense, suggesting that the problems are more [present], and that she has grown closer to her dream consciousness</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the plot of the second dream is more <strong>clear</strong>, suggesting greater <strong>intelligence and perception</strong>, whereas the first one is <strong>vague</strong> with terms such as: “walking in the forest” with “someone who hated me”\n<ul>\n<li>She understands that there is a “man” who is “black with hatred”</li>\n<li>This could show how she is maturing and hence understands her problems much better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The fact that she attempts to keep the dress unsoiled demonstrates her concern with maintaining sexual purity\n<ul>\n<li>It also shows that she is submissive towards him, which she is (in the future)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This dream foreshadows the problems she will soon face with Rochester: the pure dress represents a wedding dress and the man with “hatred” represents Rochester, and her reluctance to join him symbolizes her reluctance to join Rochester</li>\n<li>Later in the book, she blindly listens to Rochester and performs sexual intimacy (she “masochistically and insistently lays herself on [the] sexual altar” and complies to all his orders) and “[makes] no effort to save [herself]”</li>\n<li>“Smile slyly”: Rochester, stays with her just to maintain property and money, shows how detrimental marriage is to her</li>\n<li>She trips on dress and unable to get up = marriage (wedding trap) traps her and is detrimental to her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Antoinette's safety\n<ul>\n<li>She never finds safety: her house on fire, unsafe marriage, improvement in England non-existent</li>\n<li>She was unsafe because she was unloved as a daughter (because of her gender)</li>\n<li>Discrimination also haunts her</li>\n<li>Women could only gain security through marriage or the convent school\n<ul>\n<li>The convent was quite patriarchal, and Antoinette struggled to adjust there</li>\n<li>She struggled to fit as the convert was based off of religion, which is opposed to black magic, which she grew up with Christophine</li>\n<li>Therefore, the convent creates an identity crisis</li>\n<li>Antoinette learns that women must be with men at the convent school, and she is trained to be a good wife: this relates to the theme of <strong>women and freedom</strong> as women had to live their life being in control of men, by learning how to please them</li>\n<li>Antoinette knows that marriage means a loss in freedom as she will be controlled by her husband\n<ul>\n<li>She decides not to talk to anyone about this in the hope that it is not true</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Quotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Garden better, better than people: Antoinette\n<ul>\n<li>She says this after Tia Leaves her</li>\n<li>Link to

from his <strong>point of view</strong>, and although he is inhuman, his actions are explained by his suffering, confusion and feelings of alienation</li>\n<li>He is also distant from Antoinette and treats her like a stranger and analyzes her appearance critically (in a bad way)\n<ul>\n<li>He also misunderstands her local culture and considers her language inferior</li>\n<li>His detachment from heirs cleaner, so he critically evaluates her without feeling any emotions for her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It is also implied that he is detached from her own family</li>\n<li>He carelessly crushes the wedding wreaths: this foreshadows that he will treat the marriage carelessly</li>\n<li>When he and her try to connect, the differences are made more clear and his only way to understand her is to compare her to an english girl: she ”might have been any pretty English girl”</li>\n<li>Unlike Antoinette, he feels alienated and threatened by landscape and nature.</li>\n<li>There is a clear

cold as ice in the hot sun (47)”), suggesting that he feels no love of feelings/emotions for her at all</li>\n<li>One reason why he is <strong>disoriented</strong> and dislikes Antoinette with passion is because for him, she is emblematic of the Jamaican landscape, which he doesn't not enjoy as he dislikes the landscape and nature, as opposed to Antoinette, who finds comfort in nature.</li>\n<li>After seeing the letter (28), he gets lost in the forest, this can be related to Antoinette's dream\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike Antoinette, he is not well-versed with nature so he gets lost easily</li>\n<li>He also has less of an appeal to other people, so the girl was scared of him, and this is reinforced as he did not even realize/recognize Baptise looking for him, although it could

of destruction\n*   The fact that it is “Wide” shows the big gap between the two ways of life of the colonizers and the creoles\n    *   Antoinette is figuratively in between Jamaica and England\n    *   She is neither colonial nor Jamaican, she is a white creole\n*   Although Antonette marries a colonizer, there is a difference in perspectives, priorities are too wide open and different, and there is not actual union between them\n    *   Antoinette’s husband is english while Antoinette is a woman whose identity is framed by her creole nature, and her ways are different from his, and so she was not accepted by locals\n    *   So the “**wide**” sea also represents a physical and geographical separation\n\n\n# Narrators\n\n\n\n*   The novel follows a complicated narrative strategy with **multiple perspectives**\n    *   If we only saw Antoinette’s perspective, we will see her as a **biased** and **unreliable narrator**\n    *   However, we see a more **holistic view** of her and how she has been affected through the different perspectives, which bring out the different facets of her character\n*   This comes in contrast to the single narrative in _Jane Eyre_; _Wide Sargasso Sea_ is in **response** to that book\n    *   _Wide Sargasso Sea_ provides an explanation for why the madwoman exists in the first place\n    *   In _Jane Eyre_, there is only one narrative account in her name, and although she was marginalized for being poor, she didn't suffer from the racial implications\n    *   For her, the madwoman is just crazy, and she doesn’t go into details to why she is mad\n        *   To JE, the madwoman (Antoinette) is a villain in her happiness\n        *   So JR provides multiple reasons why the “madwomen” even exists, and why she is locked up\n\n\n## Part 1: Antoinette\n\n\n\n*   In Jane Eyre, Bertha Mason’s story is told from the perspective of the narrator, Jane Eyre, who views her as the ‘madwomen’\n*   In this novel, she gets to voice her own experience\n*   In the story, we see her change from child to adolescent\n\n\n### Unreliable narrator \n\n\n\n*   The narration makes the readers feel “closer” to the storyteller as she expressed her inner thoughts, feelings, and also dreams however this makes us as the readers less critical and blind to her faults as it is easier to sympathize for her\n*   Her story is full of gaps and silence, and also secrets\n    *   There are certain parts of the story she chooses not to disclose\n\n\n### Stream of consciousness\n\n\n\n*   Allows the mingling of a child’s perspective to the older narrator's memories\n*   As she watches Pierre sleep, she reflects on Mr Mason’s plans, the future, and the bamboos\n*   All these descriptions come in sharp contrast to the events yet to come\n*   At the beginning, most of the events happen in order but later, it is left to the readers understand as if they are a part of the story\n*   Stream of consciousness also reflects on her uncertainties: this is seen through her lack of traditional sentence structures, and lack of formal dialogues\n    *   Her thoughts are **disjointed** as there are gaps in understanding and narration\n*   She is only recollecting various disconnected thoughts, and sharing her personal thoughts: this gives the reader a glimpse into her mind as she does not share everything\n*   There are many gaps in the narrative (makes her an **unreliable narrator**)\n    *   One gap was after the burning down of the Coulibri\n        *   The gap shows that she feels shocked and is in a state of bewilderment or fear\n    *   There was a minor gap after Annett asks her whose dress she was wearing\n\n\n## Part 2: Antoinette’s husband\n\n\n\n*   Her husband also receives his own point of view and in the story this allows for\n    *   Different points of view on his experienced and relathips offered to readers\n    *   Readers to feel closer to his experience, and not only Antoinette’s\n*   Similar to Antoinette, he also has dislocated experienced of\n    *   New cultural experienced\n    *   Intense sensual effects of the world\n    *   Sexual passion\n    *   Memory and relations with family\n*   JR uses a range of narrative techniques for representing the confused responses to the world and people around him\n*   His first person narrative is manipulated to reveal is precarious sense of his own identity\n*   The setting is **overwhelming** to him, and he feels disconnected\n\n\n### Stream of consciousness\n\n\n\n*   His stream of consciousness makes the novel **less** **biased**, and it introduces the idea of Antoinette’s voice being **muted**, which is further emphasized by the setting change (England, a place Antoinette doesn't feel comfortable in)\n*   There are often differences in what he things and what he says\n*   He has many cultural confusions\n*   He does not understand the colonizers\n\n\n### Daniel cosway\n\n\n\n*   He provides many of the details Antoinette never told Rochester\n*   However, he does not mention the fire at the Coulibri that lead to Annette's grief and hence madness\n*   He is therefore an **unreliable narrator** \n\n\n## Part 3: Grace Poole and Antoinette\n\n\n\n*   The first italicized part is by Grace Poole, Antoinette’s jailer\n*   The second part is narrated by Antoinette, who is now the “madwoman in the attic”\n*   She employs **stream of consciousness** through inner monologue\n\n\n### Other\n\n\n\n*   Other characters are also given their own stories, although not through first-person narratives\n*   We only hear their voice through dialogs, letters\n\n\n### Annette\n\n\n\n*   We get Antoinette’s memories of her, her dialogs reported by Antoinette, gossip and comments of servants and other family members, and information given to Rochester by Daniel Cosway And Christophine\n*   Her descriptions can be contradictory as Antoinette is an **unreliable narrator**\n*   Antoinette doesn't describe her mother’s decline until she is forced to explain her family history to Rochester in Part 2\n    *   This also shows that they were never close (expanded below)\n\n\n### Aunt Cora and Mr Mason\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette’s memories, speech and dialog, gossip\n*   We also get conflicted opinions of them\n\n\n### White community\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette’s speech often slips into recounting local white gossip about her family\n*   This method of narration ensures that the voice remains hers, but also reveals the values and attitudes of the white community to which she belongs\n\n\n### Christophine\n\nHer character is constructed from\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette’s first person narrative: her importance as an influence is demonstrated by the amount of attention she is given in Antoinette’s memories\n    *   Her appearance, manner, and personality are carefully described early in Part 1.\n*   Gossip and fragments of dialog retold by Antoinette reveal the attitudes of other people\n*   Rochester’s POV: he initially sees her as a servant, but he ends up treating her with hostility once he suspects her of using obeah practices on him\n    *   Although the part is narrated by Rochester, she is given her own voice by inserting sections of dialog, in which she confronts Rochester in a very dramatic way.\n*   Letter from Mr Frazer to Rochester: we see an opinion on her held by the judicial element within the white community\n\n\n### Daniel Cosway\n\nHe is represented within Rochester's first person narration\n\n\n\n*   Letters; he sends two letters to Rochester in which he presents his perspective on Antoinette’s family background, which Fuels Rochester's suspensions about insanity\n*   Dialog: his speech is reported by Rochester\n    *   He can command in different styles of speech with rhetorical and biblical resonances\n    *   He modulates into more natural styles of speech later\n    *   However, his dialog is presented by Rochester, and is therefore colored by his perspective.\n*   He is also an **unreliable narrator**\n\n\n### Black servants and the blacks\n\n\n\n*   Mainly reported through speech and dialog in Antoinette’s narration\n*   The wider black community is notably silent in the novel\n\n\n# Structure\n\n\n\n*   There are two main narrators: **Antoinette’s husband** (unnamed) and **Antoinette**, creating a duality of antagonist and protagonist: this creates dichotomy as both are protagonists during the time they narrate the story\n*   This dichotomy creates a **contrast** in personality, themes, and cultures\n\n\n## Conflict of cultures and characters\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette is part of the West Indies culture while Rochester comes from a patriarchal, colonial power\n*   We see the differences in their ideologies: Antoinette likes nature and prefers to be in the garden while Rochester says: “I hated the mountains and the hills, the rivers and the rain. I hated the sunsets of whatever colour, I hated its beauty and it’s magic and the secret I would never know.” Whatever Antoinette describes evokes sympathy and emotion, while Rochester finds the sun and vibrant colors overwhelming: he does not understand interrelations of black and white\n\n\n## Contrast of themes\n\n\n\n*   Need to finish\n\n\n## Why is the book divided into different parts?\n\n\n\n*   To show the flow of time: from childhood, to adolescence, and then a sudden shift to marriage\n*   To show a shift in her mental status\n    *   To show that she tries to find security, but fails to do so\n        *   In Part 2, she tries to find security, but fails to do so\n\n\n### Sympathies\n\n\n\n*   In Part 1, we are sympathetic to Antoinette\n*   In Part 2, we are still sympathetic towards her\n    *   But we get to know her story through her husband, so it is counter-intuitive that we do not sympathize for the narrator\n    *   Although we see all his thoughts and motives, we don't sympathize for him\n    *   Even after known that he a victim of parental influence and manipulation (forced marriage), we don't sympathize for him\n\n\n# Part 1\n\n\n\n*   Narrated by Antoinette; she describes her childhood\n*   There is little flow in the stories with many skips between events as she recollects; one event does not lead to another\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n## Characters\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette\n    *   Her childhood experiences have shaped her character: she receives no comfort or love from her mother, and is **mocked in the society for her origins**, something she cannot control\n        *   She is constantly compared to her mother too (in a bad way), which is, again, something which is out of reach: “Look the crazy girl, you like your mother … She have eyes like zombi and you have eyes like zombi too”\n        *   This also foreshadows that she will end up like her mother\n        *   It also shows that others don't see her as a human being because she is of a different race.\n    *   Her one true friend or solace she found ended up joining the society in mocking her after stealing from her\n        *   This, in a way, caused her to be determined to be away from people, as she was neglected, and Tia betrayed her\n        *   We found out early on that her mother was not fond of her as she ignored her and seldom talked to her, so Antoinette gradually started to avoid people\n    *   Similar to the Garden (symbol), she was **left (neglected) to grow wild**, with no care or guidance\n        *   She was rejected by her mother\n        *   She also states that the company of the grasses was “better, better than people” – it is clear that she was **neglected** as a child\n    *   After the remarriage, she finds her own home **alienating** as she has a new fear of Christophine and her practices of Obeah, although she grew up trusting her\n        *   This fear is based off of gossip she hears in the wedding, and she is struggling to determine what is true\n        *   We feel sympathetic towards her as she feels unsafe in her own home\n    *   After her dress is stolen by Tia, Christophine argues with Annette about how she doesn't have any more dresses: “She run wild, she grow up worthless. And nobody care”\n    *   She is highly emotional and easily feels afraid and hatred, but learns to conceal it after numerous traumatic incidents in her life\n        *   She was forced to conceal her fears and emotions as she was neglected\n    *   She often decides not to talk about certain ideas: she decides not to verbalize certain things in the hope that they are not true\n        *   When the horse died, and when they became “marooned”, she did not tell anyone in the hope that it was not true\n        *   Also, when Mr Mason mentions a suitor, she gets a feeling of insecurity as she will lose her freedom, but she decides to ignore it in the hope that ignoring it will make it disappear\n            *   she understands the **suffocating** truths of marriage, as she has seen them in her mother\n2. Annette\n    *   Antoinette spends most of her early narration describing her mother, and see her progression from a beautiful Creole women who is ostracized by the society to a quite “thin” women who has lost any hope to live\n    *   She finally descends to madness after the fire, and learning that Pierre is dead; she loses all hopes and fears and to her death is the best way out\n        *   She has become disconnected from herself and her emotions as she has lost everything: her husband, her status (after the Emancipation act), and her son, so she chooses her ignore her family and try to escape it. \n    *   We see her signs of instability when she “speaks aloud to herself”, although the arrival of the Luttrell's gives her a new hope\n    *   She is never able to reconnect with Antoinette and wants to leave the past behind\n    *   The fact that her death/funeral is not described in detail shows the distance between Antoinette and Annette\n        *   We actually only understands what happens to the mother when she described it to Rochester; this shows the disconnect between Antoinette and her mother\n        *   Information about her that is unrevealed comes to readers through gossip, such as her death\n        *   This shows that Antoinette thought that it wasn't important anymore as she neglected her so much during childhood – their disconnect is clear\n    *   She foreshadows her daughter’s future as she goes insane as a result of what her husband did\n        *   The similarity between their names also foreshadows that they will have similar lives.\n    *   We later learn in Part 2 that she was sexualy abused by the caretakesr, but Antoinette was unable to mention it because of the trauma she was going through\t\n        *   She also refused to describe it in the hopes that it did not actually happen\n        *   The caretakers were black, and shows a role reversal as usually the white slave owners would force sexual relationships with the black slaves before emancipation\n3. Christophine\n    *   She is the one person who stands by Antoinette’s side, and she teaches her the importance of her Creole heritage and to be proud of it through her songs\n    *   She herself expresses her heritage boldy through the way she dresses, but still tries to fit in by maintaining her accent\n    *   She is feared by the locals as she practises obeah\n    *   “She was your father's wedding present”: she was a freed slave, and she shows loyalty to Annette and her family and does not abandon them\n    *   She is very close to Anette, she even says “Some people say/think [Annette] crazy” when Annette does not understand how poor they are\n        *   This also suggests the intimacy of their relationship\n    *   After the coulibri is renovated, Antoinette has a new fear of her due to obeah\n        *   Because of this and the new servants combined with her neglecting mother, she finds her new home very alienating.\n4. Tia\n    *   She is the representative of the society to Antoinette\n    *   Before making friends with Antoinette, she insulted her\n    *   When Antoinette decides to go live with her, Tia throws a rock at her forehead, showing that she was never accepted by her\n    *   She bettered Antoinette in greed for money and through of her as a “white nigger”; she also taunts Antoinette by saying “we ate salt fish”\n        *   She means to say that because Antoinette is so poor, she cannot afford fresh fish\n    *   She could be one of the driving forces in Antoinette’s life because she constantly mentions her name (in dreams and later in the book)\n    *   She stole Antoinette's clothes and hence her identity\n    *   Although they got along, money drew them apart again\n        *   The childish bet and disagreement reflects the socio-economic disparity between the whites and the blacks\n        *   The fact the Tia steals Antoinette’s dress and her money highlights the symbolic significance of appearance and attire in female power and security in the novel.\n5. Mr Mason\n    *   He is a representative of the white slave owners, a wealthy plantation owner\n    *   He portrays the theme of ignorance as he does not take Annette seriously about moving out; he is self-centered as he wants to make more money\n        *   He does not see Annette’s point of view because he does not understand racial relations on the island (similar to Rochester)\n    *   He is a new breed of the white men as he is cunning and bends laws to fit them to his liking: although the Emancipation Act ended the reign of slave owners, neo-colonialism takes place\n    *   Although Annette has no money, he still married her because he found her beautiful, but when he discovers that she is mentally ill, he locks her up in inhuman conditions\n        *   The fact that Annette and Antoinette are similar foreshadows that even Antoinette will end up in similar conditions\n        *   Sending Antoinette to be married can be similar to being locked up as she is sent against her will as she did not get a choice\n        *   In the end, she ended up getting locked up too: both their lives ended in similar ways\n    *   He has a dislike towards Aunt Cora as she did not help their family during the time of need (find page)\n        *   Furthermore, she was a successful woman, and saying that he dislikes her makes him superior as he is a man and hence he holds more power.\n    *   He misunderstands the locals and does not understand how dangerous they can be: “They're too damn lazy to be dangerous”, “They are children––they wouldn't hurt a fly”, “handful of drunken negroes”\n6. Pierre\n    *   He “staggered when he walked and couldn't speak distinctly”; he is mentally disabled \n    *   He is later described as an idiot to Rochester by Daniel Cosway the bastard\n        *   Rochester thought that the disease was genetic when it was not, so he thought Antoinette was also crazy like him\n        *   This can be linked to ADH: Dr. Rank’s diseases\n    *   Annette “changed” after hearing the doctor about Pierre’s conditions, suggesting that it was an incurable disease, that was likely a burden for the family\n7. Mr Luttrell\n    *   Kills his dog and goes to the sea never to come back\n        *   He has no money\n        *   After the Emancipation Act, he had nothing\n        *   He is a white male who was lost\n    *   He was in a state of despair following the Emancipation Act\n    *   His death sets the mood for the rest of the events, the mood of **despair and disillusionment**\n    *   His death gives Antoinette the troubled ideas of freedom\n8. Sandi Cosway\n    *   She is Antoinette’s black cousin: “I knew who he was, his name was Sandi, Alexander Cosway’s son. Once I would have said ‘my cousin Sandi’ but Mr Mason’s lectures had made me shy about my coloured relatives”\n    *   Mr Mason and his Superior Englishman attitude influenced Antoinette with Sandi Cosway\n        *   Antoinette understood that Mr Mason would not accept any friendship/relationship between her and Sandi\n        *   Mr Mason disliked Antoinette’s creole family (including Aunt Cora)\n        *   Mr Mason is also representative of the English society and their mindset, so the difference in skin color is a barrier that keeps the two apart: this social barrier is heavily linked to racial differences, which had heightened during this time period after the Emancipation Act\n\n\n## Themes\n\n\n\n1. Isolation and ostracizing based on races, and racial discrimination; alienation\n    *   Creoles are seen as being in between as they are not black or white, and are therefore not accepted in the society\n    *   Antoinette refers to non-creoles using the word “**they**” showing a disconnect and clear distinction between the two; this word is used quite early on in the novel suggestion animosity between blacks and whites in Jamaica\n    *   The fact that the family had to “[persuade] a Spanish Town doctor to visit” Pierre demonstrates the tension between the whites and blacks\n    *   The racial hierarchy in the 1830s in Jamaica was complex and strained with tensions between whites and creoles\n        *   There was resentment which lead to hatred and violence such as the Cosways being referred to as “**white cockroaches**”, and eventually being driven away from their homes from their former selves\n        *   These dynamics are also complicated by exclusion based on race, geographical origin, appearance, wealth, and status.\n    *   Major characters in the novel are defined by their inclusion or exclusion from cultural groups\n        *   Although Antoinette and the Cosways where white, they were not the dominant group of Jamaica as they were creoles.\n    *   Alienation leads to the characters of the novel being destructive too: Anette, driven by her family’s exclusions from white society, seeks marriage to Mr Mason, and this ultimately leads to the loss of her son and hence her sanity.\n    *   From the beginning, we see that Antoinette’s family is dysfunctional, and she is quite isolated because of this\n    *   The love marriage of Cosway was not happy as he had many bastard children with other women\n2. Internal isolation from family and neglect\n    *   This is one of the most prominent themes in the novel, and highly relates to Antoinette: she was constantly neglected from her mother, whose voice was neglected by Mr Mason\n    *   It was because of neglect that Annette was cast as an outsider, which leads to her mental breakdown\n3. Effect of the Emancipation Act on the society\n    *   The Emancipation Act of 1833 leaves discontent and violence as seen in Mr Luttrell, a white former slave owner, who commited suicide as he was unable to adjust to the new social and economic landscape.\n    *   Although the Emancipation Act freed slaves, slave owners suffered as shown by the Cosway family. For example, at Coulibri, the local population of black former slaves are deeply angry. Antoinette also says “They hated us”. She was also called a “white cockroach, go away, go away. Nobody want you”\n4. Ignorance and money, the reason Mr Mason did not want to leave\n5. Women and power\n    *   Annette wanted to leave the Coulibri, but was unable to as she couldn't convince Mr Mason\n        *   Similar to how the bird’s wings were clipped, she has a lack of independence in the marriage: the bird’s wings are a metaphor for her independence which is being diminished by Mr Mason\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n\n1. The garden\n    *   The garden at the Coulibri is a symbol of life, or eventually Antoinette as it too runs wild because it is uncared for\n    *   Antoinette finds comfort in the moss of the garden and enjoys wondering about the unexplored areas\n        *   She was **forced** to find comfort in the garden because she was **neglected** by annette, her mother.\n    *   Although she finds beauty in the overgrown orchids, she is afraid to go near them\n    *   Different parts of the garden may present her qualities and her desires\n    *   Antoinette described the garden with many bright colors: “green, white, purple”; she loves these colors and mentions them many times, while Rochester dislikes them and prefers brown and white instead\n    *   “Snakey” looking is a biblical allusion to the snake, which is likely overgrown?\n2. Fire\t\n    *   In the novel, fire represents **freedom and rebellion** (Part 1, page 21, 22, and the end of Part 3)\n    *   The ex-slaves set fire to the Coulibri as an act of **defiance** after being free following the Emancipation Act\n    *   “So black and white, they burn the same, eh? (23)”: this, in a way, unites the whites and the blacks\n    *   Furthermore, at the end of the play, it is suggested that Antoinette committed suicide with fire. In Jane Eyre, Antoinette (Bertha) commits suicide with fire, hence it symbolizes her **rebellion** in order to escape her husband\n3. Hair\n    *   It is a symbol of the female characters’ agency and identity\n    *   At the time of the fire, Annette’s mother had disheveled hair, showing that she is not taken seriously and that her identity doesn't mean anything to Mr Mason\n    *   The fact that Antoinette’s hair has been cut without her knowledge foreshadows that she will slowly lose her identity and agency (This is true because her husband gives her a new name, Bertha, hence she loses her identity, and she also loses her freedom and has to follow her husband's orders)\n        *   Her identity is also being lost as she has lost her father and brother, and her mother is soon to die. \n    *   Eventually, Rochester calls her Bertha, which is not her real name\n        *   This is shows that she has lost her identity\n4. Clothes\n    *   Symbolizes wealth, but only temporary in Part 1\n    *   Clothes and money are divided: as Tia steals the dress\n    *   Link to ADH: the **tarantella dress** is symbol/motif and is linked to **objectification** of women\n    *   However, the removal of dresses in ADH heads to empowerment for the women while it is (bad for Antoinette)\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n1. Beginning racism\n    *   It is a powerful opening beginning with racism: “the Jamaican ladies had never approved of my mother” – the beginning shows that they were excluded socially\n        *   Many people had criticized her mother for being a widow\n        *   This shows that in order for women to be successful, they had to have a man as they had a **lack of agency**\n    *   The fallout between Tia and Antoinette was because of a racial tension, and it also foreshadows the relation with her husband\n2. Women and agency\n    *   Women with a husband/partner have a lack of agency when compared to those who decided not to marry\n    *   This is evident in the case of Annette: she married twice and has a lack of agency and ends up being locked up\n3. Antoinette’s many dreams (pages 11 and 34)\n    *   Dreams are prevalent in Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea, in which they give us views of expressed and **unexpressed emotions**, and they **foreshadow** certain events\n    *   Dreams in Wide Sargasso Sea contain **parallel imagery** to the dreams of Jane Eyre; the dreams on Antoinette are **clairvoyant** like Jane’s dreams, which reflect on a part of her consciousness\n    *   In the novel, Antoinette has three dreams which are essentially of the same event, and they give us insight onto Antoinette’s maturing character and provide foreshadow\n    *   The first dream is in her childhood when Tia steals her pennies and dress: “I dreamed that I was walking in the forest. Not alone. Someone who hated me was with me, out of sight. I could hear heavy footsteps coming closer and though I struggled and screamed, I could not move. I woke crying.” \n        *   This reflects on the young Antoinette's **undeveloped sense of self-awareness**\n        *   The fact that it is in the **past tense** suggests that Antoinette is distances from her dream consciousness, and the vagueness of the threat in her dream suggests that she herself does not understand her fears\n        *   “Safe from the strangers”\n            *   Unknown what she is scared of\n            *   Does not understand her fears\n            *   Rudimentary dream which develops later\n    *   Both Antoinette’s and Jane’s dreams are recurring: Antoinette had her “bad dream” again at the age of seventeen when Mr Mason tells her that he is arranging for suitors to visit her\n    *   “Again I have left the house at Coulibri. It is still night and I am walking towards the forest. I am wearing a long dress and thin slippers, so I walk with difficulty, following the man who is with me and holding up the skirt of my dress. It is white and beautiful and I don't wish to get it soiled. I follow him, sick with fear but I make no effort to save myself; if anyone were to try to save me, I would refuse. This must happen. Now we have reached the forest. We are under the tall dark trees and there is no wind. \"Here?\" He turns and looks at me, his face black with hatred, and when I see this I begin to cry. He smiles slyly. \"Not here, not yet,\" he says, and I follow him, weeping. Now I do not try to hold up my dress, it trails in the dirt, my beautiful dress. We are no longer in the forest but in an enclosed garden surrounded by a stone wall and the trees are different trees. I do not know them. There are steps leading upwards. It is too dark to see the wall or the steps, but I know they are there and I think, \"It will be when I go up these steps. At the top.\" I stumble over my dress and cannot get up. I touch a tree and my arms hold on to it. 'Here, here.' But I think I will not go any further. The tree sways and jerks as if it is trying to throw me off. Still I cling and the seconds pass and each one is a thousand years. \"Here, in here,\" a strange voice said, and the tree stopped swaying and jerking. [34]”\n        *   Stream of consciousness\n        *   Unlike the first dream, this second one occurs in the present tense, suggesting that the problems are more [present], and that she has grown closer to her dream consciousness\n        *   Furthermore, the plot of the second dream is more **clear**, suggesting greater **intelligence and perception**, whereas the first one is **vague** with terms such as: “walking in the forest” with “someone who hated me”\n            *   She understands that there is a “man” who is “black with hatred”\n            *   This could show how she is maturing and hence understands her problems much better.\n        *   The fact that she attempts to keep the dress unsoiled demonstrates her concern with maintaining sexual purity\n            *   It also shows that she is submissive towards him, which she is (in the future)\n        *   This dream foreshadows the problems she will soon face with Rochester: the pure dress represents a wedding dress and the man with “hatred” represents Rochester, and her reluctance to join him symbolizes her reluctance to join Rochester\n        *   Later in the book, she blindly listens to Rochester and performs sexual intimacy (she “masochistically and insistently lays herself on [the] sexual altar” and complies to all his orders) and “[makes] no effort to save [herself]”\n        *   “Smile slyly”: Rochester, stays with her just to maintain property and money, shows how detrimental marriage is to her\n        *   She trips on dress and unable to get up = marriage (wedding trap) traps her and is detrimental to her\n4. Antoinette's safety\n    *   She never finds safety: her house on fire, unsafe marriage, improvement in England non-existent\n    *   She was unsafe because she was unloved as a daughter (because of her gender)\n    *   Discrimination also haunts her\n    *   Women could only gain security through marriage or the convent school\n        *   The convent was quite patriarchal, and Antoinette struggled to adjust there\n        *   She struggled to fit as the convert was based off of religion, which is opposed to black magic, which she grew up with Christophine\n        *   Therefore, the convent creates an identity crisis\n        *   Antoinette learns that women must be with men at the convent school, and she is trained to be a good wife: this relates to the theme of **women and freedom** as women had to live their life being in control of men, by learning how to please them\n        *   Antoinette knows that marriage means a loss in freedom as she will be controlled by her husband\n            *   She decides not to talk to anyone about this in the hope that it is not true\n\n\n## Quotes\n\n\n\n1.

Antoinette\n    *   She feels **isolation** because she cannot connect emotionally to her husband, and also because of **interracial differences** as she belongs to creoles of french\n    *   She is forced to turn to Christophone for protection when she’s scared\n        *   She asks him to make her husband love her using Obeah, but she is unable to (theme of **supernatural**)\n    *   At the end of this Part, she is referred to as a **[Doll](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.9x7rpt4yhono)**\n    *   No one knows why the town is called Massacre and its history, and this foreshadows the **fall of the marriage** and the **loss of identity** of Antoinette\n2. Her husband\n    *   This part is narrated from his **point of view**, and although he is inhuman, his actions are explained by his suffering, confusion and feelings of alienation\n    *   He is also distant from Antoinette and treats her like a stranger and analyzes her appearance critically (in a bad way)\n        *   He also misunderstands her local culture and considers her language inferior\n        *   His detachment from heirs cleaner, so he critically evaluates her without feeling any emotions for her\n    *   It is also implied that he is detached from her own family\n    *   He carelessly crushes the wedding wreaths: this foreshadows that he will treat the marriage carelessly\t\n    *   When he and her try to connect, the differences are made more clear and his only way to understand her is to compare her to an english girl: she ”might have been any pretty English girl”\n    *   Unlike Antoinette, he feels alienated and threatened by landscape and nature.\n    *   There is a clear difference between his and Antoinette’s structure in terms of emotional expression\n        *   He sees Baptiste looking mournful and finds the Caribbean way of displaying emotions as weak and vulnerable as compared to the English way of hiding and concealing emotions.\n    *   Of the wedding, he only remembers the marble and Antoinette’s **cold hands** (“It was cold as ice in the hot sun (47)”), suggesting that he feels no love of feelings/emotions for her at all\n    *   One reason why he is **disoriented** and dislikes Antoinette with passion is because for him, she is emblematic of the Jamaican landscape, which he doesn't not enjoy as he dislikes the landscape and nature, as opposed to Antoinette, who finds comfort in nature.\n    *   After seeing the letter (28), he gets lost in the forest, this can be related to Antoinette's dream\n        *   Unlike Antoinette, he is not well-versed with nature so he gets lost easily\n        *   He also has less of an appeal to other people, so the girl was scared of him, and this is reinforced as he did not even realize/recognize Baptise looking for him, although it could have been because he was quite disoriented\n        *   This comes in stark contrast to Antoinette’s dream at the end of Part 1\n    *   There is sexual tension between him and Amélie, which foreshadows their sexual relationship\n    *   He pities himself, although Antoinette is the bigger victim\n        *   He is able to self-pity as he holds more power in their relationship\n    *   We never see him working; he is living off the money he earned as a slave owner\n    *   He has limited power as compared to other english men as he was the second son\n        *   He had no choice; he was forced to listen to his father\n        *   But he still made his own (bad, incorrect) choices like cheating on Antoinette when he could have been a better husband, so readers do not sympathize for him (even though we see everything from his point of view)\n    *   He wants to care for Antoinette, but decides not to due to his bitter feelings\n        *   He also does not care for the boy who learned English in the hopes of staying with him\n        *   When the boy cries like that, he feels he is crying “for nothing”, reiterating the fact that he shows no remorse\n        *   After a struggle between compassion and bitterness, bitterness has taken over completely\n3. Daniel Cosway\n    *   He is another character similar to Antoinette who has led a life of inherited suffering\n        *   His is likely her half-brother, a result of Cosway and a slave\n    *   While Antoinette is culturally different from everyone else around her, Daniel is racially different as he has a black mother and white father\n    *   Daniel is a bastard son, similar to Antoinette who was rejected as a child by her mother\n    *   Both he and Antoinette share their sense of **isolation, displacement, and anger**\n    *   Letter of page 59: he is spiteful and attacks Antoinette and his and her family by stating how madness runs in the family\t\n        *   There were tensions between emancipated slaves and their owners.\n    *   He wants revenge on Antoinette and the Cosways as his existence was **marginalized**\n        *   He holds them responsible for his situation\n    *   No one is truly sure about his identity and origins\n        *   Even Amélie, who seems to know him is unsure about his real name\n        *   Everyone relies on gossip to know who is truly is\n4. Christophine\n    *   She believes that most women are foolish to rely only on their husbands, so she stays single so that she can stay independent, although she has had three children from different men\n    *   She also has her own money: “I keep my money. I don't give it to no worthless man”\n    *   When Christophine gives Antoinette her inheritance, the wealth now belongs to her husband\n        *   She and Antoinette loses money this way\n        *   She calls Mr Mason “worse than Satan” as he got Antoinette and forced her (sold her) into marrying Rochester\n    *   She is shown to not easily trust people; her distrust is clear\n        *   she does not believe that England exists: “I never see the damn place, how I know?”\n        *   This differentiates her from Antoinette, who relies on trust (she trusts her geography books)\n        *   Christophone treats that place she has never personally experienced with skepticism\n        *   She also does not even trust her own son (Jo-jo) to not leak out what Antoinette and her have been planning: she described him as “Nothing but leaky calabash that boy\"\n    *   She uses obeah to make Rochester love Antoinette again, but ends up fleeing as he knows that she has drugged him\n        *   This gets her in trouble with the law, so she has to leave Antoinette, and cannot help her anymore as she is powerless\n        *   It is Mr Fraser who informs the husband that she is a practitioner of Obeah and considers her dangerous as she has a criminal record\n5. Aunt Cora\n    *   She is shown to be defeated in comparison to Christophine as she “she turned her face to the wall”\n    *   She was unable to help Antoinette escape the control of Mr Mason and Richard Mason, who married her to Rochester to get money\n6. Amélie\n    *   A maid at Granbois who shows no respect for the husband and Antoinette, although she fears Christophone\n    *   She flirtatiously mocks Rochester until he sleeps with her\n    *   She has sex with the husband, and Antoinette is fully aware of it\n        *   Her husband decides to sleep with her just to mess with Antoinette and maker her weaker than she already is\n7. The Young Bull\n    *   His name illustrates his aggressive desire for dominance\n    *   He tries to impress Rochester by showing that he can speak English and demonstrating his knowledge\n\n\n## Themes\n\n\n\n1. Alienation\n    *   Daniel Cosway, a mixed-race illegitimate child of Cosway, wants to gain revenge for everyone marginalizing his existence\n        *   His exclusion from the Cosway family leads to him to write a series of letters to Rochester **maligning** Antoinette and the rest of her family\n    *   These **letters** disturb Rochester and are the **catalyst** for his ultimate distrust and distaste for Antoinette (Link to ADH as paper is [catalyst](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14igPyB0lxPZeZ2p34UE9-ixrHa0yAOzMx6adBIR9Wkw/edit#heading=h.jx83je1nb652))\n2. Obeah and colonial mindset\n    *   Everyone feared obeah for what it could do\n    *   Antoinette’s husband has a colonial viewpoint, so he distrusted Christophine for her Obeah practices\n    *   Through obeah, Antoinette tries to change her husband\n    *   When the husband knows that he has been manipulated by obeah, he decides to take away Antoinette's **identity** by naming her Bertha\n        *   He attacks her physcologically\n        *   This changing of her name also shows that he holds all the power in the relationship\n        *   It is ironic that an unnamed character is able to strip a named (main) character from her identity so easily; this shows how much power colonial men had (patriarchal society)\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n\n1. Typical white colonists of the time (see Antoinette’s husband remains unnamed in Part 2)\n    *   He is not named, and Rhys generalizes all white colonists to be similar to him\n        *   Rhys wants us to sympathize for Antoinette (even though her husband is the narrator), and she does this by not giving him a name\n    *   Being a colonist, he is a person who ‘extracts what he needs’: for this reason, he disliked nature\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette’s husband remains unnamed\n    *   This is done so that the writer can use his character to represent all typical white colonists – he is symbolic to all of them as he is a perfect example of one\n    *   This is furthered by the fact that he does not work and he only drinks; white colonists would have all the servants do work for them\n    *   Furthermore, the writer only wants to represent the point of view of Antoinette, so giving him a name and hence an identity is difficult and will go against the main point in the novel\n    *   It is deeply **ironic** that the **unnamed** character robbed the main characters of her name and her identity: although he is unnamed, he holds power as he is a man\n    *   He also wants to distance himself from her\n    *   Not giving him a name essentially generalizes him and all other white colonial men\n    *   On the other hand, women are individualized, as Antoinette is given a name and also given more emphasis to as this is a feminist novel\n    *   The story is also mainly through the feminine perspective, and his name is not mentioned so that Antoinette can occupy the center stage\n    *   The fact that he is unnamed also creates a **cold sense of unfamiliarity** which allows to relate with Antoinette as she is also in anew place\n2. The letter from Daniel Cosway\n    *   Antoinette’s husband says that he was expecting the letter, and this shows that he never truly loved her: “I felt no surprise. It was as if I’d expected it, been waiting for it (62)”\n    *   Daniel writes a letter to Rochester stating that he is an illegitimate child of Mr Cosway\n    *   Similar to A Doll’s House, paper is a catalyst\n\n\n# Part 3\n\n\n\n*   Narrated by Grace Poole, a character who gives a **less biased** view of the story\n*   There are shifting perspectives, which allows people to interpret their own view: multidimensional nature of the characters: “there is always another side (82)”\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\n\n*   This part is in the POV of Grace Poole\n*   Antoinette is being kept in the attic of her husband’s house against her will with Grace Poole\n*   Later, the narration switches back to Antoinette’s consciousness and Grace Poole tells her that Richard Mason visited, and that Antoinette attacked him with a knife\n\n\n## Characters\n\n\n\n1. Antoinette’s husband (Rochester)\n    *   Rochester sleeps with Amelie as he feels alienated with Antoinnette\n    *   Christiphone uses Obeah to make Rochester desire Antoinette, but it only had little effect\n    *   hough he got sexually attracted to her, he still sleeps with Amelie as he **suspects** Antoinette – he is **vindictive** as he knows he’s been messed with, and he is also very **manipulative**\n    *   We learn that he has been manipulated by his father in marrying Antoinette, he did not have a choice in this decision\n        *   This makes the readers sympathize for him, but his later actions on Antoinette show that he is inhuman\n    *   He is quite critical of Antoinette’s beauty and objectifies her: he breaks down every component of her face and looks at her with hatred\n        *   He also says that her beauty is a “trick of the light”, showing that he only finds her beautiful at specific times of the day\n        *   He also feels that she is manipulative, as she used Obeah to make him love her\n2. Antoinette\n    *   She is going crazy, just like her mother, and her death is also foreshadowed by her husband: “I drew the sheet over her gently as if I covered a dead girl”; it also states that he marriage satisfaction is dead\n    *   She is unsure about how much time passes as she is going crazy after being alone\n    *   The fact that she doesn't remember attacking Richard Mason with a knife shows that she is losing consciousness\n        *   She cannot remember her violent actions and believes that she didn't recognize Richard Mason\n        *   She also said that she saw a girl in a white dress and thought it was a ghost; this is most likely Jane Eyre\n    *   The red dress reminds her of the relationship she had with Sandi Cosway\n    *   She drops the red dress\n        *   When it spreads like fire, she is one step closer to what she wishes to do\n        *   The color red symbolizes her passion\n    *   She steals Grace’s keys to explore the house\n    *   She has everything taken away from her\n        *   She cannot even please Rochester as she ever sees him again\n        *   She does not have a mirror to see how she herself looks \n    *   At the end, she has a dream about setting the house to fire, climbing on top, then jumping to her death\n        *   This reminds her of the fire in the Coulibri\n        *   When she wakes up, she decides to act out her dream, although it is unclear\n    *   Dreams: again, the dream foreshadows what will truly happened\n3. Grace Poole\n    *   She narrates the first part of Part 3\n        *   She seems to be an **unreliable narrator** as she gossips\n    *   She is paid twice as much as any other servant to keep quiet about the “madwoman in the attic”, although she is uncomfortable about Antoinette’s conditions\n        *   However, she often falls asleep, allowing Antoinette to take her keys and roam around the house\n    *   She was also in Jane Eyre\n    *   She says: “the world outside…can be a black and cruel world to a woman”; where **black** is a reference to one of Antoinette's dreams, where she was being chased by a man “black with hatred”\n    *   Unlike Christophine, she only takes care of her for money; she subdied her for money\n        *   Christophine, on the other hand was more concerned for Antoinette; she awsa s supporting mother figure for her\n\n\n## Themes\n\n\n## Symbols\n\n\n\n1. Fire\n    *   When Grace Poole lit a fire, Antoinette admires its beauty and wonders why she was locked in the attic\n        *   At this point, her narration is hazy and she only observes things that happen around her\n    *   Fire is both destructive and redemptive in the novel\n        *   In both cases, it was used to rebel too: first the slaves rebelled against the Cosway family, then Antoinette rebelled against her husband\n    *   Antoinette’s dream was in a way **foreshadowed** by** Coco flying into the flames**\n        *   The wings area symbol of **independence**, and Antoinette did not have any, so she thought that she was better off dead\n        *   Through suicide she gains freedom and betrays Rochester\n2. Red dress\n    *   The red dress triggers many memories (that were left out earlier in the narration) for Antoinette\n        *   For example, her and Sandi’s relation: he also asked her if she wanted to elope and they often kissed\n        *   She does not share this with Grace Poole, reinforcing her distrust of her\n    *   Her red dress comes in stark contrast to the white dress of the white girl she saw (Jane Eyre)\n        *   The dress symbolizes passion\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n1. Similarities between Rochester and Antoinette\n    *   Both are delusional and both were neglected at childhood and then forced to marry; both like rum – it allowed them to escape reality\n    *   They were alcoholics as they did not have work at the plantation because no more slaves, so the only thing to do was drink. This created a state of disarray as the transition from slaves to no slaves was very abrupt\n2. Marriage\n    *   There is some hypocrisy: Rochester received money as a dowry in marrying Antoinette, while Amelie paid Rochester money to have sex with him\n    *   The first one is socially acceptable and the other one is socially unacceptable\n3. Names\n    *   After starting at the tapestry hanging on her wall for a long time, she starts seeing her mother, but doesn't tell Grace about it – she is hallucinating and slowly losing her sanity\n        *   She feels disconnected from her identity\n    *   She also notes that “Grace” does not fit Grace Poole, and seems to have a distrust of her\n4. Antoinette’s death; shouting Tia\n    *   When she jumps into the fire, she decides to shout Tia’s name\n\n\n# More notes\n\n\n## Slavery\n\n\n\n*   In Wide Sargasso Sea, the Emancipation act led to the freedom of the slaves\n*   But slavery also exists between husband and wife, as seen by Antoinette and her husband: this is a different type of slavery\n*   Slavery also extends to post-colonial slavery\n    *   Antoinette’s husband tells Christophe that he will turn her for her Obeah practices\n    *   This suppression continues even after the Emancipation act\n\n\n## Burning of houses\n\n\n\n*   Two houses burned down in the novel\n*   The burning of the houses is a symbolism and parallelism\n    *   First the slaves burned the house to avenge themselves\n    *   It is implied that Antoinette, at the end of the novel, burns her husband’s house down to escape\n        *   She killed herself in the process, so she lays down her life in the hope to be free and destroy her husband\n        *   She shows her agency by doing this\n\n\n## Antoinette’s agency\n\n\n\n*   She tries to \n\n\n# Themes\n\n\n## Identity\n\n\n\n*   Antoinette does not fit in anywhere as she is a creole English\n    *   She is neither Jamaican nor from England, so she feels like an outsider, and others also treat her like one\n*   Chrisophone, on the other hand is portrayed as Caribbean, while Antoinette does not fit it anywhere\n\n\n## Slavery and freedom\n\n\n\n*   Conflict is created between the newly emancipated slaves and their owners\n    *   Their interactions lead to the bringdown of the Coulibri\n\n\n## Power\n\n\n\n*   Chrisotophone has access to Obeah\n*   Rochester has the power to change Antoinette’s name\n\n\n## Money\n\n\n## Women and power\n\n\n\n*   The female characters in Wide Sargasso Sea were confronted by societal forces that prevent them from acting and sustaining themselves\n*   The only socially acceptable ways for a woman to attain security were marriage and entering the convert \n*   In Annette’s case, the marriage destroyed not only hers, but also her children’s lives\n    *   Alexander Cosway, the first husband had many affairs publicly, and therefore many bastard children\n    *   When he died, he left the family destitute\n    *   He ignored her pleas to move out, which ended up killing Pierre and causing her to descend to madness\n    *   Antoinette was forced to marry Rochester by Mr Mason for money: this marriage was only done for financial benefit to Rochester and Mr Mason; he essentially sold her\n*   Rochester sleeps with Amelie, without making any effort to hide it from Antoinette, while still on their honeymoon\n*   The female characters who embody strength and agency are those who decide to remain outside the control of men/husbands\n    *   One example is Christophone\n        *   Christophine was respected in her community for her expertise in Obeah, and Antoinette also depended on her\n        *   She states that “Women must have spunks to live in this wicked world”, and ““All women, all colours, nothing but fools. Three children I have. One living in this world, each one a different father, but no husband, I thank my God. I keep my money. I don’t give it to no worthless man”\n    *   Auto Cora is a widow who does not remarry\n        *   She was relatively stable, and able to control her health and movements\n        *   She also promises safety for Antoinette \n*   Amelie is a minor character who also demonstrates that power can be with those outside traditional marriages\n    *   She manipulates sex to exercise to gain control over her employers, so she sleeps with and receives money from Rochester\n    *   She also says that she plans to move to Rio to continue the same tactic: “She wanted to go to Rio. There were rich men in Rio”\n\n\n## Horror novel\n\n\n\n*   Wide Sargasso Sea explores ideas of domestic abuse and cruelty\n*   For example, rochester renames Antoinette\n    *   Antoinette first has a name, then it is taken from her. This shows how she lost her identity to the unnamed character\n    *   He renames her Bertha, just like a slave-owner renaming its possessions, in order to assert his dominance, and distance himesend from her heritage and alleged madness\n    *   He has also taken her money, property, sense of security, emotional happiness, secual dignity, and finally her name\n    *   He calls her laugh a “crazy laugh”, which justifies in his delusion, his abuse of her\n    *   He also pretends to believe that she has harmed him: “You deceived me, betrayed me”\n    *   He also reduced her to a “doll” and a “marionette”, a plaything and object to be manipulated\n    *   At the end, he describes her as if he is on the perpetrator of her destruction: “only a ghost … nothing left but hopelessness”\n    *   He also makes sure he can never get away from her: “She’s mad but mine … my lunatic.

<em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em> is in <strong>response</strong> to that book\n<ul>\n<li><em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em> provides an explanation for why the madwoman exists in the first place</li>\n<li>In <em>Jane Eyre</em>, there is only one narrative account in her name, and although she was marginalized for being poor, she didn't suffer from the racial implications</li>\n<li>For her, the madwoman is just crazy, and she doesn’t go into details to why she is mad\n<ul>\n<li>To JE, the madwoman (Antoinette) is a villain in her happiness</li>\n<li>So JR provides multiple reasons why the “madwomen” even exists, and why she is locked up</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part 1: Antoinette</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In Jane Eyre, Bertha Mason’s story is told from the perspective of the narrator, Jane Eyre, who views her as the ‘madwomen’</li>\n<li>In this novel, she gets to voice her own experience</li>\n<li>In the story, we see her change from child to adolescent</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unreliable narrator</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The narration makes the readers feel “closer” to the storyteller as she expressed her inner thoughts, feelings, and also dreams however this makes us as the readers less critical and blind to her faults as it is easier to sympathize for her</li>\n<li>Her story is full of gaps and silence, and also secrets\n<ul>\n<li>There are certain parts of the story she chooses not to disclose</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stream of consciousness</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows the mingling of a child’s perspective to the older narrator's memories</li>\n<li>As she watches Pierre sleep, she reflects on Mr Mason’s plans, the future, and the bamboos</li>\n<li>All these descriptions come in sharp contrast to the events yet to come</li>\n<li>At the beginning, most of the events happen in order but later, it is left to the readers understand as if they are a part of the story</li>\n<li>Stream of consciousness also reflects on her uncertainties: this is seen through her lack of traditional sentence structures, and lack of formal dialogues\n<ul>\n<li>Her thoughts are <strong>disjointed</strong> as there are gaps in understanding and narration</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She is only recollecting various disconnected thoughts, and sharing her personal thoughts: this gives the reader a glimpse into her mind as she does not share everything</li>\n<li>There are many gaps in the narrative (makes her an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong>)\n<ul>\n<li>One gap was after the burning down of the Coulibri\n<ul>\n<li>The gap shows that she feels shocked and is in a state of bewilderment or fear</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There was a minor gap after Annett asks her whose dress she was wearing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part 2: Antoinette’s husband</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Her husband also receives his own point of view and in the story this allows for\n<ul>\n<li>Different points of view on his experienced and relathips offered to readers</li>\n<li>Readers to feel closer to his experience, and not only Antoinette’s</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Similar to Antoinette, he also has dislocated experienced of\n<ul>\n<li>New cultural experienced</li>\n<li>Intense sensual effects of the world</li>\n<li>Sexual passion</li>\n<li>Memory and relations with family</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>JR uses a range of narrative techniques for representing the confused responses to the world and people around him</li>\n<li>His first person narrative is manipulated to reveal is precarious sense of his own identity</li>\n<li>The setting is <strong>overwhelming</strong> to him, and he feels disconnected</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stream of consciousness</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>His stream of consciousness makes the novel <strong>less</strong> <strong>biased</strong>, and it introduces the idea of Antoinette’s voice being <strong>muted</strong>, which is further emphasized by the setting change (England, a place Antoinette doesn't feel comfortable in)</li>\n<li>There are often differences in what he things and what he says</li>\n<li>He has many cultural confusions</li>\n<li>He does not understand the colonizers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Daniel cosway</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>He provides many of the details Antoinette never told Rochester</li>\n<li>However, he does not mention the fire at the Coulibri that lead to Annette's grief and hence madness</li>\n<li>He is therefore an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part 3: Grace Poole and Antoinette</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The first italicized part is by Grace Poole, Antoinette’s jailer</li>\n<li>The second part is narrated by Antoinette, who is now the “madwoman in the attic”</li>\n<li>She employs <strong>stream of consciousness</strong> through inner monologue</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Other characters are also given their own stories, although not through first-person narratives</li>\n<li>We only hear their voice through dialogs, letters</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Annette</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We get Antoinette’s memories of her, her dialogs reported by Antoinette, gossip and comments of servants and other family members, and information given to Rochester by Daniel Cosway And Christophine</li>\n<li>Her descriptions can be contradictory as Antoinette is an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n<li>Antoinette doesn't describe her mother’s decline until she is forced to explain her family history to Rochester in Part 2\n<ul>\n<li>This also shows that they were never close (expanded below)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Aunt Cora and Mr Mason</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s memories, speech and dialog, gossip</li>\n<li>We also get conflicted opinions of them</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>White community</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s speech often slips into recounting local white gossip about her family</li>\n<li>This method of narration ensures that the voice remains hers, but also reveals the values and attitudes of the white community to which she belongs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Christophine</h3>\n<p>Her character is constructed from</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s first person narrative: her importance as an influence is demonstrated by the amount of attention she is given in Antoinette’s memories\n<ul>\n<li>Her appearance, manner, and personality are carefully described early in Part 1.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gossip and fragments of dialog retold by Antoinette reveal the attitudes of other people</li>\n<li>Rochester’s POV: he initially sees her as a servant, but he ends up treating her with hostility once he suspects her of using obeah practices on him\n<ul>\n<li>Although the part is narrated by Rochester, she is given her own voice by inserting sections of dialog, in which she confronts Rochester in a very dramatic way.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Letter from Mr Frazer to Rochester: we see an opinion on her held by the judicial element within the white community</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Daniel Cosway</h3>\n<p>He is represented within Rochester's first person narration</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Letters; he sends two letters to Rochester in which he presents his perspective on Antoinette’s family background, which Fuels Rochester's suspensions about insanity</li>\n<li>Dialog: his speech is reported by Rochester\n<ul>\n<li>He can command in different styles of speech with rhetorical and biblical resonances</li>\n<li>He modulates into more natural styles of speech later</li>\n<li>However, his dialog is presented by Rochester, and is therefore colored by his perspective.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He is also an <strong>unreliable narrator</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Black servants and the blacks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mainly reported through speech and dialog in Antoinette’s narration</li>\n<li>The wider black community is notably silent in the novel</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Structure</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>There are two main narrators: <strong>Antoinette’s husband</strong> (unnamed) and <strong>Antoinette</strong>, creating a duality of antagonist and protagonist: this creates dichotomy as both are protagonists during the time they narrate the story</li>\n<li>This dichotomy creates a <strong>contrast</strong> in personality, themes, and cultures</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conflict of cultures and characters</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette is part of the West Indies culture while Rochester comes from a patriarchal, colonial power</li>\n<li>We see the differences in their ideologies: Antoinette likes nature and prefers to be in the garden while Rochester says: “I hated the mountains and the hills, the rivers and the rain. I hated the sunsets of whatever colour, I hated its beauty and it’s magic and the secret I would never know.” Whatever Antoinette describes evokes sympathy and emotion, while Rochester finds the sun and vibrant colors overwhelming: he does not understand interrelations of black and white</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contrast of themes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Need to finish</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why is the book divided into different parts?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To show the flow of time: from childhood, to adolescence, and then a sudden shift to marriage</li>\n<li>To show a shift in her mental status\n<ul>\n<li>To show that she tries to find security, but fails to do so\n<ul>\n<li>In Part 2, she tries to find security, but fails to do so</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sympathies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In Part 1, we are sympathetic to Antoinette</li>\n<li>In Part 2, we are still sympathetic towards her\n<ul>\n<li>But we get to know her story through her husband, so it is counter-intuitive that we do not sympathize for the narrator</li>\n<li>Although we see all his thoughts and motives, we don't sympathize for him</li>\n<li>Even after known that he a victim of parental influence and manipulation (forced marriage), we don't sympathize for him</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Part 1</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Narrated by Antoinette; she describes her childhood</li>\n<li>There is little flow in the stories with many skips between events as she recollects; one event does not lead to another</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<h2>Characters</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Antoinette\n<ul>\n<li>Her childhood experiences have shaped her character: she receives no comfort or love from her mother, and is <strong>mocked in the society for her origins</strong>, something she cannot control\n<ul>\n<li>She is constantly compared to her mother too (in a bad way), which is, again, something which is out of reach: “Look the crazy girl, you like your mother … She have eyes like zombi and you have eyes like zombi too”</li>\n<li>This also foreshadows that she will end up like her mother</li>\n<li>It also shows that others don't see her as a human being because she is of a different race.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Her one true friend or solace she found ended up joining the society in mocking her after stealing from her\n<ul>\n<li>This, in a way, caused her to be determined to be away from people, as she was neglected, and Tia betrayed her</li>\n<li>We found out early on that her mother was not fond of her as she ignored her and seldom talked to her, so Antoinette gradually started to avoid people</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Similar to the Garden (symbol), she was <strong>left (neglected) to grow wild</strong>, with no care or guidance\n<ul>\n<li>She was rejected by her mother</li>\n<li>She also states that the company of the grasses was “better, better than people” – it is clear that she was <strong>neglected</strong> as a child</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After the remarriage, she finds her own home <strong>alienating</strong> as she has a new fear of Christophine and her practices of Obeah, although she grew up trusting her\n<ul>\n<li>This fear is based off of gossip she hears in the wedding, and she is struggling to determine what is true</li>\n<li>We feel sympathetic towards her as she feels unsafe in her own home</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After her dress is stolen by Tia, Christophine argues with Annette about how she doesn't have any more dresses: “She run wild, she grow up worthless. And nobody care”</li>\n<li>She is highly emotional and easily feels afraid and hatred, but learns to conceal it after numerous traumatic incidents in her life\n<ul>\n<li>She was forced to conceal her fears and emotions as she was neglected</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She often decides not to talk about certain ideas: she decides not to verbalize certain things in the hope that they are not true\n<ul>\n<li>When the horse died, and when they became “marooned”, she did not tell anyone in the hope that it was not true</li>\n<li>Also, when Mr Mason mentions a suitor, she gets a feeling of insecurity as she will lose her freedom, but she decides to ignore it in the hope that ignoring it will make it disappear\n<ul>\n<li>she understands the <strong>suffocating</strong> truths of marriage, as she has seen them in her mother</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Annette\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette spends most of her early narration describing her mother, and see her progression from a beautiful Creole women who is ostracized by the society to a quite “thin” women who has lost any hope to live</li>\n<li>She finally descends to madness after the fire, and learning that Pierre is dead; she loses all hopes and fears and to her death is the best way out\n<ul>\n<li>She has become disconnected from herself and her emotions as she has lost everything: her husband, her status (after the Emancipation act), and her son, so she chooses her ignore her family and try to escape it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We see her signs of instability when she “speaks aloud to herself”, although the arrival of the Luttrell's gives her a new hope</li>\n<li>She is never able to reconnect with Antoinette and wants to leave the past behind</li>\n<li>The fact that her death/funeral is not described in detail shows the distance between Antoinette and Annette\n<ul>\n<li>We actually only understands what happens to the mother when she described it to Rochester; this shows the disconnect between Antoinette and her mother</li>\n<li>Information about her that is unrevealed comes to readers through gossip, such as her death</li>\n<li>This shows that Antoinette thought that it wasn't important anymore as she neglected her so much during childhood – their disconnect is clear</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She foreshadows her daughter’s future as she goes insane as a result of what her husband did\n<ul>\n<li>The similarity between their names also foreshadows that they will have similar lives.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We later learn in Part 2 that she was sexualy abused by the caretakesr, but Antoinette was unable to mention it because of the trauma she was going through\n<ul>\n<li>She also refused to describe it in the hopes that it did not actually happen</li>\n<li>The caretakers were black, and shows a role reversal as usually the white slave owners would force sexual relationships with the black slaves before emancipation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Christophine\n<ul>\n<li>She is the one person who stands by Antoinette’s side, and she teaches her the importance of her Creole heritage and to be proud of it through her songs</li>\n<li>She herself expresses her heritage boldy through the way she dresses, but still tries to fit in by maintaining her accent</li>\n<li>She is feared by the locals as she practises obeah</li>\n<li>“She was your father's wedding present”: she was a freed slave, and she shows loyalty to Annette and her family and does not abandon them</li>\n<li>She is very close to Anette, she even says “Some people say/think [Annette] crazy” when Annette does not understand how poor they are\n<ul>\n<li>This also suggests the intimacy of their relationship</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After the coulibri is renovated, Antoinette has a new fear of her due to obeah\n<ul>\n<li>Because of this and the new servants combined with her neglecting mother, she finds her new home very alienating.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tia\n<ul>\n<li>She is the representative of the society to Antoinette</li>\n<li>Before making friends with Antoinette, she insulted her</li>\n<li>When Antoinette decides to go live with her, Tia throws a rock at her forehead, showing that she was never accepted by her</li>\n<li>She bettered Antoinette in greed for money and through of her as a “white nigger”; she also taunts Antoinette by saying “we ate salt fish”\n<ul>\n<li>She means to say that because Antoinette is so poor, she cannot afford fresh fish</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She could be one of the driving forces in Antoinette’s life because she constantly mentions her name (in dreams and later in the book)</li>\n<li>She stole Antoinette's clothes and hence her identity</li>\n<li>Although they got along, money drew them apart again\n<ul>\n<li>The childish bet and disagreement reflects the socio-economic disparity between the whites and the blacks</li>\n<li>The fact the Tia steals Antoinette’s dress and her money highlights the symbolic significance of appearance and attire in female power and security in the novel.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mr Mason\n<ul>\n<li>He is a representative of the white slave owners, a wealthy plantation owner</li>\n<li>He portrays the theme of ignorance as he does not take Annette seriously about moving out; he is self-centered as he wants to make more money\n<ul>\n<li>He does not see Annette’s point of view because he does not understand racial relations on the island (similar to Rochester)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He is a new breed of the white men as he is cunning and bends laws to fit them to his liking: although the Emancipation Act ended the reign of slave owners, neo-colonialism takes place</li>\n<li>Although Annette has no money, he still married her because he found her beautiful, but when he discovers that she is mentally ill, he locks her up in inhuman conditions\n<ul>\n<li>The fact that Annette and Antoinette are similar foreshadows that even Antoinette will end up in similar conditions</li>\n<li>Sending Antoinette to be married can be similar to being locked up as she is sent against her will as she did not get a choice</li>\n<li>In the end, she ended up getting locked up too: both their lives ended in similar ways</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He has a dislike towards Aunt Cora as she did not help their family during the time of need (find page)\n<ul>\n<li>Furthermore, she was a successful woman, and saying that he dislikes her makes him superior as he is a man and hence he holds more power.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He misunderstands the locals and does not understand how dangerous they can be: “They're too damn lazy to be dangerous”, “They are children––they wouldn't hurt a fly”, “handful of drunken negroes”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Pierre\n<ul>\n<li>He “staggered when he walked and couldn't speak distinctly”; he is mentally disabled</li>\n<li>He is later described as an idiot to Rochester by Daniel Cosway the bastard\n<ul>\n<li>Rochester thought that the disease was genetic when it was not, so he thought Antoinette was also crazy like him</li>\n<li>This can be linked to ADH: Dr. Rank’s diseases</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Annette “changed” after hearing the doctor about Pierre’s conditions, suggesting that it was an incurable disease, that was likely a burden for the family</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mr Luttrell\n<ul>\n<li>Kills his dog and goes to the sea never to come back\n<ul>\n<li>He has no money</li>\n<li>After the Emancipation Act, he had nothing</li>\n<li>He is a white male who was lost</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He was in a state of despair following the Emancipation Act</li>\n<li>His death sets the mood for the rest of the events, the mood of <strong>despair and disillusionment</strong></li>\n<li>His death gives Antoinette the troubled ideas of freedom</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Sandi Cosway\n<ul>\n<li>She is Antoinette’s black cousin: “I knew who he was, his name was Sandi, Alexander Cosway’s son. Once I would have said ‘my cousin Sandi’ but Mr Mason’s lectures had made me shy about my coloured relatives”</li>\n<li>Mr Mason and his Superior Englishman attitude influenced Antoinette with Sandi Cosway\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette understood that Mr Mason would not accept any friendship/relationship between her and Sandi</li>\n<li>Mr Mason disliked Antoinette’s creole family (including Aunt Cora)</li>\n<li>Mr Mason is also representative of the English society and their mindset, so the difference in skin color is a barrier that keeps the two apart: this social barrier is heavily linked to racial differences, which had heightened during this time period after the Emancipation Act</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Themes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Isolation and ostracizing based on races, and racial discrimination; alienation\n<ul>\n<li>Creoles are seen as being in between as they are not black or white, and are therefore not accepted in the society</li>\n<li>Antoinette refers to non-creoles using the word “<strong>they</strong>” showing a disconnect and clear distinction between the two; this word is used quite early on in the novel suggestion animosity between blacks and whites in Jamaica</li>\n<li>The fact that the family had to “[persuade] a Spanish Town doctor to visit” Pierre demonstrates the tension between the whites and blacks</li>\n<li>The racial hierarchy in the 1830s in Jamaica was complex and strained with tensions between whites and creoles\n<ul>\n<li>There was resentment which lead to hatred and violence such as the Cosways being referred to as “<strong>white cockroaches</strong>”, and eventually being driven away from their homes from their former selves</li>\n<li>These dynamics are also complicated by exclusion based on race, geographical origin, appearance, wealth, and status.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Major characters in the novel are defined by their inclusion or exclusion from cultural groups\n<ul>\n<li>Although Antoinette and the Cosways where white, they were not the dominant group of Jamaica as they were creoles.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Alienation leads to the characters of the novel being destructive too: Anette, driven by her family’s exclusions from white society, seeks marriage to Mr Mason, and this ultimately leads to the loss of her son and hence her sanity.</li>\n<li>From the beginning, we see that Antoinette’s family is dysfunctional, and she is quite isolated because of this</li>\n<li>The love marriage of Cosway was not happy as he had many bastard children with other women</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Internal isolation from family and neglect\n<ul>\n<li>This is one of the most prominent themes in the novel, and highly relates to Antoinette: she was constantly neglected from her mother, whose voice was neglected by Mr Mason</li>\n<li>It was because of neglect that Annette was cast as an outsider, which leads to her mental breakdown</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Effect of the Emancipation Act on the society\n<ul>\n<li>The Emancipation Act of 1833 leaves discontent and violence as seen in Mr Luttrell, a white former slave owner, who commited suicide as he was unable to adjust to the new social and economic landscape.</li>\n<li>Although the Emancipation Act freed slaves, slave owners suffered as shown by the Cosway family. For example, at Coulibri, the local population of black former slaves are deeply angry. Antoinette also says “They hated us”. She was also called a “white cockroach, go away, go away. Nobody want you”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ignorance and money, the reason Mr Mason did not want to leave</li>\n<li>Women and power\n<ul>\n<li>Annette wanted to leave the Coulibri, but was unable to as she couldn't convince Mr Mason\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to how the bird’s wings were clipped, she has a lack of independence in the marriage: the bird’s wings are a metaphor for her independence which is being diminished by Mr Mason</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The garden\n<ul>\n<li>The garden at the Coulibri is a symbol of life, or eventually Antoinette as it too runs wild because it is uncared for</li>\n<li>Antoinette finds comfort in the moss of the garden and enjoys wondering about the unexplored areas\n<ul>\n<li>She was <strong>forced</strong> to find comfort in the garden because she was <strong>neglected</strong> by annette, her mother.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Although she finds beauty in the overgrown orchids, she is afraid to go near them</li>\n<li>Different parts of the garden may present her qualities and her desires</li>\n<li>Antoinette described the garden with many bright colors: “green, white, purple”; she loves these colors and mentions them many times, while Rochester dislikes them and prefers brown and white instead</li>\n<li>“Snakey” looking is a biblical allusion to the snake, which is likely overgrown?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fire\n<ul>\n<li>In the novel, fire represents <strong>freedom and rebellion</strong> (Part 1, page 21, 22, and the end of Part 3)</li>\n<li>The ex-slaves set fire to the Coulibri as an act of <strong>defiance</strong> after being free following the Emancipation Act</li>\n<li>“So black and white, they burn the same, eh? (23)”: this, in a way, unites the whites and the blacks</li>\n<li>Furthermore, at the end of the play, it is suggested that Antoinette committed suicide with fire. In Jane Eyre, Antoinette (Bertha) commits suicide with fire, hence it symbolizes her <strong>rebellion</strong> in order to escape her husband</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hair\n<ul>\n<li>It is a symbol of the female characters’ agency and identity</li>\n<li>At the time of the fire, Annette’s mother had disheveled hair, showing that she is not taken seriously and that her identity doesn't mean anything to Mr Mason</li>\n<li>The fact that Antoinette’s hair has been cut without her knowledge foreshadows that she will slowly lose her identity and agency (This is true because her husband gives her a new name, Bertha, hence she loses her identity, and she also loses her freedom and has to follow her husband's orders)\n<ul>\n<li>Her identity is also being lost as she has lost her father and brother, and her mother is soon to die.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Eventually, Rochester calls her Bertha, which is not her real name\n<ul>\n<li>This is shows that she has lost her identity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Clothes\n<ul>\n<li>Symbolizes wealth, but only temporary in Part 1</li>\n<li>Clothes and money are divided: as Tia steals the dress</li>\n<li>Link to ADH: the <strong>tarantella dress</strong> is symbol/motif and is linked to <strong>objectification</strong> of women</li>\n<li>However, the removal of dresses in ADH heads to empowerment for the women while it is (bad for Antoinette)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Beginning racism\n<ul>\n<li>It is a powerful opening beginning with racism: “the Jamaican ladies had never approved of my mother” – the beginning shows that they were excluded socially\n<ul>\n<li>Many people had criticized her mother for being a widow</li>\n<li>This shows that in order for women to be successful, they had to have a man as they had a <strong>lack of agency</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The fallout between Tia and Antoinette was because of a racial tension, and it also foreshadows the relation with her husband</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Women and agency\n<ul>\n<li>Women with a husband/partner have a lack of agency when compared to those who decided not to marry</li>\n<li>This is evident in the case of Annette: she married twice and has a lack of agency and ends up being locked up</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Antoinette’s many dreams (pages 11 and 34)\n<ul>\n<li>Dreams are prevalent in Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea, in which they give us views of expressed and <strong>unexpressed emotions</strong>, and they <strong>foreshadow</strong> certain events</li>\n<li>Dreams in Wide Sargasso Sea contain <strong>parallel imagery</strong> to the dreams of Jane Eyre; the dreams on Antoinette are <strong>clairvoyant</strong> like Jane’s dreams, which reflect on a part of her consciousness</li>\n<li>In the novel, Antoinette has three dreams which are essentially of the same event, and they give us insight onto Antoinette’s maturing character and provide foreshadow</li>\n<li>The first dream is in her childhood when Tia steals her pennies and dress: “I dreamed that I was walking in the forest. Not alone. Someone who hated me was with me, out of sight. I could hear heavy footsteps coming closer and though I struggled and screamed, I could not move. I woke crying.”\n<ul>\n<li>This reflects on the young Antoinette's <strong>undeveloped sense of self-awareness</strong></li>\n<li>The fact that it is in the <strong>past tense</strong> suggests that Antoinette is distances from her dream consciousness, and the vagueness of the threat in her dream suggests that she herself does not understand her fears</li>\n<li>“Safe from the strangers”\n<ul>\n<li>Unknown what she is scared of</li>\n<li>Does not understand her fears</li>\n<li>Rudimentary dream which develops later</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Both Antoinette’s and Jane’s dreams are recurring: Antoinette had her “bad dream” again at the age of seventeen when Mr Mason tells her that he is arranging for suitors to visit her</li>\n<li>“Again I have left the house at Coulibri. It is still night and I am walking towards the forest. I am wearing a long dress and thin slippers, so I walk with difficulty, following the man who is with me and holding up the skirt of my dress. It is white and beautiful and I don't wish to get it soiled. I follow him, sick with fear but I make no effort to save myself; if anyone were to try to save me, I would refuse. This must happen. Now we have reached the forest. We are under the tall dark trees and there is no wind. &quot;Here?&quot; He turns and looks at me, his face black with hatred, and when I see this I begin to cry. He smiles slyly. &quot;Not here, not yet,&quot; he says, and I follow him, weeping. Now I do not try to hold up my dress, it trails in the dirt, my beautiful dress. We are no longer in the forest but in an enclosed garden surrounded by a stone wall and the trees are different trees. I do not know them. There are steps leading upwards. It is too dark to see the wall or the steps, but I know they are there and I think, &quot;It will be when I go up these steps. At the top.&quot; I stumble over my dress and cannot get up. I touch a tree and my arms hold on to it. 'Here, here.' But I think I will not go any further. The tree sways and jerks as if it is trying to throw me off.

to her dream consciousness</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the plot of the second dream is more <strong>clear</strong>, suggesting greater <strong>intelligence and perception</strong>, whereas the first one is <strong>vague</strong> with terms such as: “walking in the forest” with “someone who hated me”\n<ul>\n<li>She understands that there is a “man” who is “black with hatred”</li>\n<li>This could show how she is maturing and hence understands her problems much better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The fact that she attempts to keep the dress unsoiled demonstrates her concern with maintaining sexual purity\n<ul>\n<li>It also shows that she is submissive towards him, which she is (in the future)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This dream foreshadows the problems she will soon face with Rochester: the pure dress represents a wedding dress and the man with “hatred” represents Rochester, and her reluctance to join him symbolizes her reluctance to join Rochester</li>\n<li>Later in the book, she blindly listens to Rochester and performs sexual intimacy (she “masochistically and insistently lays herself on [the] sexual altar” and complies to all his orders) and “[makes] no effort to save [herself]”</li>\n<li>“Smile slyly”: Rochester, stays with her just to maintain property and money, shows how detrimental marriage is to her</li>\n<li>She trips on dress and unable to get up = marriage

marriage or the convent school\n<ul>\n<li>The convent was quite patriarchal, and Antoinette struggled to adjust there</li>\n<li>She struggled to fit as the convert was based off of religion, which is opposed to black magic, which she grew up with Christophine</li>\n<li>Therefore, the convent creates an identity crisis</li>\n<li>Antoinette learns that women must be with men at the convent school, and she is trained to be a good wife: this relates to the theme of <strong>women and freedom</strong> as women had to live their life being in control of men, by learning how to please

from his <strong>point of view</strong>, and although he is inhuman, his actions are explained by his suffering, confusion and feelings of alienation</li>\n<li>He is also distant from Antoinette and treats her like a stranger and analyzes her appearance critically (in a bad way)\n<ul>\n<li>He also misunderstands her local culture and considers her language inferior</li>\n<li>His detachment from heirs cleaner, so he critically evaluates her without feeling any emotions for her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It is also implied that he is detached from her own family</li>\n<li>He carelessly crushes the wedding wreaths: this foreshadows that he will treat the marriage carelessly</li>\n<li>When he and her try to connect, the differences are made more clear and his only way to understand her is to compare her to an english girl: she ”might have been any pretty English girl”</li>\n<li>Unlike Antoinette, he feels alienated and threatened by landscape and nature.</li>\n<li>There is a clear difference between his and Antoinette’s structure in terms of emotional expression\n<ul>\n<li>He sees Baptiste looking mournful and finds the Caribbean way of displaying emotions as weak and vulnerable as compared to the English way of hiding and concealing emotions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Of the wedding, he only remembers the marble and Antoinette’s <strong>cold hands</strong> (“It was cold as ice in the hot sun (47)”), suggesting that he feels no love of feelings/emotions for her at all</li>\n<li>One reason why he is <strong>disoriented</strong> and dislikes Antoinette with passion is because for him, she is emblematic of the Jamaican landscape, which he doesn't not enjoy as he dislikes the landscape and nature, as opposed to Antoinette, who finds comfort in nature.</li>\n<li>After seeing the letter (28), he gets lost in the forest, this can be related to Antoinette's dream\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike Antoinette, he is not well-versed with nature so he gets lost easily</li>\n<li>He also has less of an appeal to other people, so the girl was scared of him, and this is reinforced as he did not even realize/recognize Baptise looking for him, although it could have been because he was quite disoriented</li>\n<li>This comes in stark contrast to Antoinette’s dream at the end of Part 1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There is sexual tension between him and Amélie,

relationship</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We never see him working; he is living off the money he earned as a slave owner</li>\n<li>He has limited power as compared to other english men as he was the second son\n<ul>\n<li>He had no choice; he was forced to listen to his father</li>\n<li>But he still made his own (bad, incorrect) choices like cheating on Antoinette when he could have been a better husband, so readers do not sympathize for him (even though we see everything from his point of view)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>He wants to care for Antoinette, but decides not to due to his bitter feelings\n<ul>\n<li>He also does not care for the boy who learned English in the hopes of staying with him</li>\n<li>When the boy cries like that, he feels he is crying “for nothing”, reiterating the fact that he shows no remorse</li>\n<li>After a struggle between compassion and bitterness, bitterness has taken over completely</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Daniel Cosway\n<ul>\n<li>He is another character similar to Antoinette who has led a life of inherited suffering\n<ul>\n<li>His is likely her half-brother, a result of Cosway and a slave</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>While Antoinette is culturally different from everyone else around her, Daniel is racially different as he has a black mother and white father</li>\n<li>Daniel is a bastard son, similar to Antoinette who was rejected as

white colonists would have all the servants do work for them</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the writer only wants to represent the point of view of Antoinette, so giving him a name and hence an identity is difficult and will go against the main point in the novel</li>\n<li>It is deeply <strong>ironic</strong> that the <strong>unnamed</strong> character robbed the main characters of her name and her identity: although he is unnamed, he holds power as he is a man</li>\n<li>He also wants to distance himself from her</li>\n<li>Not giving him a name essentially generalizes him and all other white colonial men</li>\n<li>On the other hand, women are individualized, as Antoinette is given a name and also given more emphasis to as this is a feminist novel</li>\n<li>The story is also mainly through the feminine perspective, and his name is not mentioned so that Antoinette can occupy the center stage</li>\n<li>The fact that he is unnamed also creates a <strong>cold sense of unfamiliarity</strong> which allows to relate with Antoinette as she is also in anew place</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The letter from Daniel Cosway\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s husband says that he was expecting the letter, and this shows that he never truly loved her: “I felt no surprise.

This created a state of disarray as the transition from slaves to no slaves was very abrupt</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Marriage\n<ul>\n<li>There is some hypocrisy: Rochester received money as a dowry in marrying Antoinette, while Amelie paid Rochester money to have sex with him</li>\n<li>The first one is socially acceptable and the other one is socially unacceptable</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Names\n<ul>\n<li>After starting at the tapestry hanging on her wall for a long time, she starts seeing her mother, but doesn't tell Grace about it – she is hallucinating and slowly losing her sanity\n<ul>\n<li>She feels disconnected from her identity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>She also notes that “Grace” does not fit Grace Poole, and seems to have a distrust of her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Antoinette’s death; shouting Tia\n<ul>\n<li>When she jumps into the fire, she decides to shout Tia’s name</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>More notes</h1>\n<h2>Slavery</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In Wide Sargasso Sea, the Emancipation act led to the freedom of the slaves</li>\n<li>But slavery also exists between husband and wife, as seen by Antoinette and her husband: this is a different type of slavery</li>\n<li>Slavery also extends to post-colonial slavery\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette’s husband tells Christophe that he will turn her for her Obeah practices</li>\n<li>This suppression continues even after the Emancipation act</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Burning of houses</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Two houses burned down in the novel</li>\n<li>The burning of the houses is a symbolism and parallelism\n<ul>\n<li>First the slaves burned the house to avenge themselves</li>\n<li>It is implied that Antoinette, at the end of the novel, burns her husband’s house down to escape\n<ul>\n<li>She killed herself in the process, so she lays down her life in the hope to be free and destroy her husband</li>\n<li>She shows her agency by doing this</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Antoinette’s agency</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>She tries to</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Themes</h1>\n<h2>Identity</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Antoinette does not fit in anywhere as she is a creole English\n<ul>\n<li>She is neither Jamaican nor from England, so she feels like an outsider, and others also treat her like one</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Chrisophone, on the other hand is portrayed as Caribbean, while Antoinette does not fit it anywhere</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Slavery and freedom</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Conflict is created between the newly emancipated slaves and their owners\n<ul>\n<li>Their interactions lead to the bringdown of the Coulibri</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Power</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Chrisotophone has access to Obeah</li>\n<li>Rochester has the power to change Antoinette’s name</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Money</h2>\n<h2>Women and power</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The female characters in Wide Sargasso Sea were confronted by societal forces that prevent them from acting and sustaining themselves</li>\n<li>The only socially acceptable ways for a woman to attain security were marriage and entering the convert</li>\n<li>In Annette’s case, the marriage destroyed not only hers, but also her children’s lives\n<ul>\n<li>Alexander Cosway, the first husband had many affairs publicly, and therefore many bastard children</li>\n<li>When he died, he left the family destitute</li>\n<li>He ignored her pleas to move out, which ended up killing Pierre and causing her to descend to madness</li>\n<li>Antoinette was forced to marry Rochester by Mr Mason for money: this marriage was only done for financial benefit to Rochester and Mr Mason; he essentially sold her</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Rochester sleeps with Amelie, without making any effort to hide it from Antoinette, while still on their honeymoon</li>\n<li>The female characters who embody strength and agency are those who decide to remain outside the control of men/husbands\n<ul>\n<li>One example is Christophone\n<ul>\n<li>Christophine was respected in her community for her expertise in Obeah, and Antoinette also depended on her</li>\n<li>She states that “Women must have spunks to live in this wicked world”, and ““All women, all colours, nothing but fools.
