Positive feedback\n    *   Ice caps\n        *   Melting of polar ice caps = lower albedo\n        *   Less ice = less reflection of radiation\n        *   So more energy absorbed, hence an increase in temperature\n    *   Melting ice and water\n        *   Melt Ice ice = more water = bigger waves\n        *   Larger waves break up sea ice\n        *   Water is less reflective, so more energy absorbed, hence an increase in temperature\n    *   Permafrost\n        *   Thawing of permafrost = increase in methane levels\n        *   Adding to the GHGs\n        *   So increase in temperature because heat is prevented from leaving\n2. Negative feedback\n    *   Burning, leading to more aerosols, and reduced solar radiation, causing cooling (global dimming)\n    *   Increased evaporation, leading to more cooling\n\nCase study: negative feedback in Greenland\n\n\n## Enhanced greenhouse effect\n\n\n\n*   The **enhanced greenhouse effect** is the impact of increasing levels of greenhouse gases as a result of human activities, often referred to as **global warming**\n*   The increase in the world's greenhouse gases is linked to industrialization, trade, and globalization\n\n\n# Consequences of global climate change\n\n\n## Implications\n\n\n\n*   Sea-level rise: floods to low-lying areas such as the Maldives, and Bangladesh\n*   Storm activity increase\n*   Agricultural patterns change: USA’s grain belt will shrink and production will decline, while Canada's goriing season will get longer and more productive\n*   Less rainfall over the USA, southern Europe, and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\n*   Up to **40%** of wildlife species will go extinct in the Amazon, Miombo woodlands of South Africa (African elephants, sundarban tigers, and also sea-animals such as sharks)\n\n\n### Hydrosphere\n\n\n\n*   Rise in sea-levels flooding low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, Netherlands, Egypt, displacing over 200 million people\n    *   Water expands in heat, leading to a higher increase in sea-level, of from 40–80 cm\n*   Floods from melting glaciers treating over 4 M km<sup>2</sup> of land\n\n\n### Case study: climate change impacts on the UK\n\n\n\n*   Temperature rise of 1.5–4.5ºC\n*   Sea-level rise by 20–40 cm (around 3 mm per year, as predicted by the government)\n*   Trees: deciduous trees would replace conifers\n*   Plants: crocuses and daffodils would only grow in the north; maize will only grow in the south\n*   Birds: Arctic species such as Snow bunting and Dotterel will face extinction; Greenshank and Dunlin under threat\n*   Flooding defences to be rebuilt in low-lying areas: Kent, East Angelica\n*   More heat waves, like those in 2003, which killed over 2000 people in the UK: they are expected to become the norm by the 2040s\n*   Vector-borne diseases: more risks from new and emerging pests and diseases\n    *   The higher temperatures extends the range of certain insects and pests\n    *   Milder, lower temperature, winters also increase the survival rate of these pests\n\n\n### Changes in sea ice\n\n\n\n*   Melting season of Arctic increase\n*   As sea ice recedes, potential for wave formation reduces\n*   Larger waves help break up sea ice, establishing positive feedback of disappearing sea ice and wave formation\n    *   In 2012, a 5-meter wave was recorded in the Beaufort Sea\n*   Methane emissions from tundra will increase because \n*   Polar bears have less time to hunt seal, and must spend more time on land\n    *   There is also a reduced body size, and decreased reproductive success\n\n\n### Glaciers and ice caps\n\n\n\n*   The Himalayan glaciers are retreating\n    *   This may have a major impact on the region’s water supply (the Hindu Kush Himalayan region; glacier treatment could water shortages for up to 1.5 B people)\n*   Combined with other factors such as population growth and high density of population, this issue is made worse\n\n\n### Case study: retreat of Swiss glaciers\n\n\n\n*   The Swiss Alps declined from 1,800 km<sup>2</sup> in 1850 to 1,300 km<sup>2</sup> in 1972, a loss of ⅓ of the surface area\n*   The glacier changed substantially between 1882 and 2015\n    *   In 1882, it was 15 km long\n    *   Between 1883 and 1885, it grew slowly, around 4 km; it remained steady for a few years\n    *   It then repeated 26 m/yr for the next couple of years\n    *   By 1920, it was retreating 10 m/yr\n    *   Annual rates increase  in the 1920s\n    *   In 2007–8, it retreated drastically, a total of 290 m\n*   It has retreated over 2.5 km over the last 130 years due to global warming\n*   Problems include\n    *   Economic: loss of homes and tourism (tourist guides and ski hotels lose tourists and hence income)\n    *   Social: less tourists arrive, tribes and displaced people must migrate\n    *   Environmental: loss of habitat and biomes as the alps receded for animals such as the Alpine ibex and Chamois\n\n\n## Changes in carbon stored in ice, oceans, and biosphere\n\n\n\n*   Before the industrial revolution, the amount of ice stored on land, in oceans, and in the biosphere was balanced, but human activity has tipped the balance\n*   Before the industrial revolution, the carbon concentration would only change through\n    *   Volcanic eruptions\n    *   Sea-floor spreading\n*   In the 1990s, human activity added 8.0 PgC, 6.4 of which acme from burning fossil fuels\n    *   The oceans absorbed 28% and the land 32%, the rest remaining in the atmosphere \n*   But in 2000–8, human activity added 9.1 PgC to the atmosphere annually, 7.7 PgC from fossil fuels and 1.4 PgC from deforestation and land -use change \n\n\n### Oceans\n\n\n\n*   More carbon increases warms the atmosphere and makes plants grow faster and store more carbon\n*   An increased carbon in the atmosphere has lead to more dissolving in the oceans\n    *   This endangers much marine life, especially shell-building animals as the acids dissolve and weaken the shells (weaken the carbonates of crabs and lobsters, and they end up with thinner shells)\n    *   The pH of water has dropped by 0.1 since 1750\n*   Warmer oceans decrease the abundance of phytoplankton, which grow more vigorously in cool, nutrient-rich waters such \n\n\n### Biosphere\n\n\n\n*   With the doubling carbon dioxide, plant growth increases by 12–76%\n*   Many forests are cleared for agricultural zones\n    *   However, if farmland is abandoned, such as in **Montserrat**, the vegetation ma revert to forest\n    *   By preventing wildfires, humans prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere, and instead it builds up in plants\n        *   Therefore, the use of fire to create new farmland releases considerable amounts of carbon into the atmosphere\n\n\n### Ice\n\n\n\n*   Permafrost contain large deposits of carbon, accumulate over thousands of years\n*   The low temperature reduces the rate of decomposition of organic plant matter, leading an accumulation of dead organic matter\n*   Warming of the peric glacier environments will lead to increased methane emissions\n*   Decreases show reduced reflectivity of the surface, increasing the absorption of solar radiation (positive feedback)\n\n\n## Changes in biomes\n\n\n\n*   Low-lying biomes such sa **mangroves** may be lost as a result of changes in sea level\n*   Climate change in the past has happened over long periods of time, allowing animals to adapt gradually to new conditions\n    *   Current increases in temperature are happening very rapidly, so there is less time for organisms to adapt\n    *   Organisms will either have to migrate or go extinct if they’re unable to adapt\n\n\n### Changes to agriculture\n\n\n\n*   Northward shift of wheat-growing in North America\n*   More difficult to irrigate fields due to limited water resources\n\n\n## Impact of climate change on people and places\n\n\n\n*   Organisms-based diseases such as malaria: new hotter conditions are better for mosquitoes to breed\n*   Migration due to changes in sea-level causes environmental-refugees\n*   Changes in tourism\n    *   Extended summers, which o=is good for coastal resorts in North America\n    *   Winter sports stopped due to lack of snow (in Aviemore, an in the Alps)\n    *   Reduced precipitation makes some locations economic due to water shortage\n\n\n### Social\n\n\n\n*   Hunger and conflict\n\n\n# Responding to climate change\n\n\n## Disparities in exposure\n\n\n\n*   **Exposure** is the degree to which people are exposed to climate change\n*   **Sensitivity** is the degree to which people could be harmed by exposure to climate change\n*   **Adaptive capacity** is the degree to which they could mitigate the potential harm by taking action to reduce their exposure or sensitivity\n*   Certain **populations** are more **vulnerable** than others: the very young, elderly, disabled, poor, minority groups, refugees, and indigenous people\n*   Certain **locations** are more **vulnerable** than others: low-lying islands, river mouths, valleys, coastal areas, regions deriving water supplies from mountain glaciers; therefore they face\n    *   Increased coastal erosion\n    *   Saline intrusion into groundwater supplies\n    *   Deterioration of coral reefs\n    *   Out-migration of people\n    *   Loss of income due to a decline in economic activities and infrastructure\n\n\n## Case study: Flooding in Bangladesh\n\n\n\n*   Most of Bangladesh lives along a delta formed by **three rivers** (**the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra**), which periodically flood the land\n    *   This is essential as it naturally irrigate the crops and increases soil fertility\n    *   However, since 1970, the scale, impact, and duration of these floods has increased, and there are still scientific prediction that it will continue increasing\n    *   A rise in temperatures of **2.6ºC** will lead to widespread repeated flooding\n    *   Due to **sea-level rise**, the densely populated coastal zone of Bangladesh is also increasingly vulnerable to coastal floods\n*   The flood damage is worsening due to the increased intensity of extreme precipitation events and the **14-40%** increase in monsoon rainfalls by the 2030s\n    *   Since 1990, the frencuney of extreme precipitation has increased in Narayanpur island as normal floods have become more catastrophic\n        *   Fewer than 1% can reach medical help within 1 hour as there is no suitable transport for those living by the indian border\n        *   People often have to sell assets post a flood to buy food and equipment\n*   Government and non-government organizations have been involved in reducing the impacts of flooding in Bangladesh\n    *   In 1988, after the most severe floodings of the 20th century, the government developed the **Flood Action Plan**\n        *   Sluice gates were built on a number of rivers, which provided protection from flooding by tidal waves and storm surges\n    *   5,700 km of embankments were also built\n    *   Neary 5,000 km of drainage channels were built\n    *   200 flood shelters on stilts for equation of people threatened by floods\n        *   Watch has brick toilets and septic tanks to reduce water contamination\n*   Impacts of the flood include\n    *   Personal security\n        *   Deaths from drowning, diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid\n        *   Loss of income\n        *   Loss or unavailability of fuelwood\n    *   Buildings and infrastructure\n        *   Tin-wall and mud houses washed away\n        *   Damage to temples, and factories\n    *   Crops and animals\n        *   Loss of livestock\n        *   Grain shortages\n        *   Damage to vegetation\n\n\n## Case study: Vulnerability and adaptation in Ghana\n\n\n\n*   In Ghana in West Africa, there are a number of adaptations include\n    *   Infrastructure development: building dams, levees, and seawalls\n    *   Ecosystem-based measures: preserving and restoring natural habitats such as mangrove swamps\n    *   Capacity development: education and to teach people new techniques and to empower people\n*   There are different impacts and adaptations in different zones\n    *   Northern Savanna\n        *   Increased morbidity and disease prevalence\n        *   Increased vulnerability of the poor\n        *   Increased out-mediation and loss of human capital\n    *   Forest\n        *   Decreased food security \n        *   Dry-ups of water bodies and underground water\n        *   Population pressure on land\n    *   Coastal Savanna\n        *   Decreased water availability and quality\n        *   Higher burden on women\n        *   Increased migration\n        *   Increased cholera\n\n\n## Government-led action\n\n\n### The UN Framework Concentration on climate change (1992)\n\n\n\n*   The objective was to prevent GHGs in the atmosphere to grow to dangerous levels\n*   It went into effect in 1994, but failed\n*   The **Kyoto Protocol (1997)** was the first major attempt to implement the treaty\n    *   HICs were required to cut carbon emissions by 20% by 2012 compared to the 1990 emissions\n    *   The US didn't sign while Canada and Australia did\n",html:"<h1>Causes of global climate change</h1>\n<h2>Structure of the
