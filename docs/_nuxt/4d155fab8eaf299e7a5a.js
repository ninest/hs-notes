reduction was a goal of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) between **2000 and 2015**, and was a success:\n    *   1990: 50% of people in LICs lived on less than $1.25\n    *   2015: only 14%\n    *   The number of people living in extreme poverty fell from 1.9 B in 1990 to 836 M in 2015\n*   At the same time, the number of people in the middle class tripled between **1990 and 2015** (people living on at leat $4/day)\n    *   This is because of the increase in average incomes and the fall in the number of people living in absolute poverty\n    *   Thi is a good economic feature as it helps increase the sales of goods such as phones, cars, electronic goods: the sales of cars increased by over **800%** since 2009\n    *   However, in the 1980s Brazil the middle class accounted for less than 30% of the population since the 1960s, unlike South Korea, where the middle class accounted for 50%\n*   Hover, not all the middle class has **economic security** as many people on incomes of over $4/day remain vulnerable to un(der)employment\n    *   **800 M people** still live in extreme poverty including workers, living in unsafe conditions\n    *   People are also disadvantages on accounts of race and gender: in Latin America, women are more likely to live in poverty than men\n        *   The proportion has increased from 108 women to 100 men in 1997 to 117 women to 100 men in 2012\n    *   Globally, **75%** of men are part of global labor force, but only **50%** of women are, and women earn on average **25%** less than men\n\n\n## Global consumption of resources\n\n\n### Ecological footprints\n\n\n\n*   An **ecological footprint** is the hypothetical area of land required by a society, group, or individual to fulfill all their resource needs and assimilate their wastes\n*   A country **increases** the ecological footprint through\n    *   Relying on fossil fuels\n    *   Higher levels of imported resources (higher transport)\n    *   Meat-rich diets\n    *   High technology and energy use\n    *   Large population\n*   A country **reduces** the ecological footprint through\n    *   Reducing the amount of resources used\n    *   Recycling and reusing\n    *   Improving resource use and efficiency\n    *   Improve technology to increase carrying capacity\n    *   Technology to improve and increase land use\n    *   Reducing population (anti-natalist policies)\n\n\n### Ecological footprints in HICs and LICs\n\n\n\n*   HICs, in general, have higher disposable incomes which means that consumption and demand for energy resources are high, and their resource use is more wasteful\n    *   Meat-eating diets are more prevalent in HICs, where **30%** of the diet is based off of animal protein\n        *   Meat-eating diets in general use more land than the vegetarian diet as animals use **90%** of the for they eat for other processes such as respiration\n*   People in LICs, by contrast, have less to spend\n    *   Resources are often recycled through the informal economy\n*   GHG emissions from agriculture also affect the total footprint\n    *   According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the agriculture sector emist between 5.1 and 6.1 B tonnes of GHG annually, about **11%** of the total GHG emissions\n*   Populations more **dependent on fossil fuels** have higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions\n\n\n## Patterns and trends in water availability and consumption\n\n\n\n*   **Embedded/virtual water** refers to the way in which water is transferred from one country to another through its exports\n*   Water is unevenly distributed: about **780 M** people do not have access to clean water, and this number will increase in 2015, when the world population will likely reach around **9 B**\n*   HICs maintain or increase their consumption of resources such as water, although an increasing portion of this water is embedded in agricultural and manufactured products\n*   Land grabs and transfer lead to loss of water\n    *   **Saudi Arabia** cut production of cerails at home by **12%**, and with a series of land grabs, produced the cereals it needed in parts of Africa\n*   Various trends **increase** the pressure on water\n    *   Population growth, expected to reach **9 B **by **2050**\n    *   Growing middle class: increasing affluence leads to greater water consumption (showers, baths, gardening)\n    *   Growth of **tourism** and recreation (golf courses, water parks, pools)\n    *   Urbanization: urban areas require significant water investment to get water to people and to remove waste products hygienically\n    *   Climate change\n\n\n## Patterns and trends in the availability of land and food consumption\n\n\n\n*   The food intake has **increased** in mainly the NICs, and is **constant** in LICs such as countries in Southern Africa\n*   HICs are adopting a more varied diet including meats\n*   The fast-food industry is growing in HICs and LICs as their demand increases\n    *   Food demand is inelastic as a person’s food consumption only increases up to a certain point\n*   Since 1961, the total fish supply and consumption increases by about 3.6% per year while the world’s population has grown by 1.8% over the same period\n    *   Production from the world’s ocean fisheries has levelled off since the 1970s, largely because of overfishing\n*   Growth rates of food production and crop yields have been falling\n    *   This can be due to natural hazards (fires, floods, draughts), climate change, and use of land to produce biofuels\n    *   Food shortages also lead to riots in Indonesia, Egypt, and North Africa\n*   Ways of increasing crop production:\n    *   Expanding the area farmed\n    *   Multicropping, often using irrigation\n    *   Using high-yielding varieties or genetically modified organisms\n\n\n### Patterns and trends in availability and consumption of energy\n\n\n\n*   Energy insecurity has risen for a number of reasons\n    *   Increased demand, especially from NICs\n    *   Decreased reserves as supplies are used up\n    *   Global warming and natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina (2005) increased awareness of the misuse of energy resources\n*   A diversified energy mix offers the most energy security\n*   The Middle East controls 50% of the world’s remaining oil reserves and Saudi Arabia controls 20%\n    *   USA consumes 200 M barrels/day but possess less than 2% of the world’s oil reserves, so it has to source much of its oil from overseas, notably the middle east\n    *   This gives the Middle East economic and political advantage, and countries that want oil have to stay on friendly terms with them\n    *   Countries that depend on their region for oil need to\n        *   Ensure political stability of the Middle East\n        *   Maintain good political links with the Middle East\n        *   Involve the Middle East in economic cooperation\n\n\n# 3.2 Impacts of changing trends in resource consumption\n\n[Never completed this]\n\n\n## Case study: resource security in the Hindu Kush region\n\n\n\n*   South Asia has 3% of the world’s land, but around 25% of the world’s population\n*   Food, emgy, and water security are therefore important, however, around 20% of the population lack access to safe drinking water\n\n\n### Nexus\n\n\n\n*   The nexus approach to food, water, and energy is an integrated method for achieving security in all three elements\n*   The ecosystem services provided by the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH( region are vital for the security of all three sectors (1.3 B people rely on water from the HKH region)\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\n*   Rapid population growth, rapid urbanization, industrialization, uncertainties of climate change\n*   Thee
