<h1>Different methods of database recovery</h1>
<ul>
<li>Undoing: if a transaction crashes, they can be undone so that none of the data is lost</li>
<li>Caching/buffering: a record of the data is saved and restored</li>
<li>Backups: databases can be backed up and stored in a different location from the original</li>
<li>Hardware repair: in order to effectively recover all the data</li>
<li>Overwritten data: if the data has been replaced by other data accidentally</li>
</ul>
<h1>Situations in which recovery happens</h1>
<ul>
<li>Human error, accidental deletion</li>
<li>Malicious activity</li>
<li>Power outages</li>
<li>Malfunctions</li>
<li>Logical errors</li>
<li>Physical damage to drive</li>
<li>Corrupt files: the hard disk can become unreadable due to damage of the file system or media errors</li>
</ul>
<h1>Issues relating to cost of data recovery systems and importance of data</h1>
<ul>
<li>Effects are worse for large businesses in which the data is crucial for the business</li>
<li>For smaller data storage devices such as pen drives, data loss might not be that important as the data was not very important</li>
<li>Hard disk drive repair: depends on cost, and how much data there is to recover</li>
<li>Big firms, banks, businesses will pay for the data to be recovered</li>
<li>Creation of a backup: which is not as expensive</li>
<li>Recovery via software solution: depends on how much data is recovered</li>
<li>File repair does not take much money and is cheaper</li>
</ul>
