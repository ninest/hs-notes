*   Each packet is formatted, addressed, and routed
*   Packets sent by different routes
*   Making the complete message more difficult to intercept
*   Less likely to be affected by network failure
*   Individual packets can be sent by different routes
*   So if one route is down, others can be used

18. Identify two ways in which security of network within hospital can be ensured [2]
*   Each user should have a password that is changed regularly
*   Each computer should have access rights depending on location
*   Computers should not be unattended
19. Describe how data could be recovered in case of corruption [4]
*   All data should be backed up daily/weekly
*   So most recent backup of master file is loaded during corruption
20. Outline how the network administrator can reduce the risk that sensitive data is only seen by a doctor [4]
*   Each user should have appropriate access rights
*   Passwords should be encrypted
*   File systems should be encrypted
*   Administrator should record who has logged on from which computer and for how long</li>
<li>This is a question in wires
21. Outline advantages of WLAN over LAN [4]
*   Use on the move: more versatile staff, encouraged to collaborate
*   Allows employees to use their own devices: leads to greater productivity as familiarity with device
*   No extra equipment is needed for expansion after initial setup, therefore improved safety for employees
22. Discuss issues and how to resolve [4]
*   Data can be intercepted
*   Resolved using strong encryption, WPA2, trusted MAC address, regular hanches of <span style="text-decoration:underline">router</span> password

<li>Each item in a static array can be directly accessed whilst access to the items in linked list is sequential</li>
<li>And searching for a given item in linked list is slower, as it cannot be searches for using binary search</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explain benefits of using BST compared to stack when searching for a specific item [3]
<ul>
<li>Time efficiency
<ul>
<li>Data in BST is ordered</li>
<li>Such that as each node is checked for the item, half the remaining nodes are ignored</li>
<li>While all the elements in the stack have to be checked</li>
<li>So for large data sets, stacks may be inefficient as compared to BST</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Memory efficiency
<ul>
<li>Each element on the stack has to be removed to be checked</li>
<li>When item is found, the stack’s contents will be changed</li>
<li>But when the element is found in the BST, the contents are not removed from the BST</li>
<li>So there is no need to create an additional copy of the BST, but a copy of a stack needs to be created</li>

<li>A singly linked list is slower and less efficient as it is a <strong>linear/sequential</strong> data structure</li>
<li>More storage is required in a binary tree as it requires two pointers, and less storage is required for a singly linked list as it requires only one pointer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outline why recursive solutions can be memory intensive [2]

State tasks performed by a compiler\n    *   translates HLL to machine code\n    *   generates error messages\n    *   accesses built-in routines provided by HLL used\n    *   creates a separate machine language program\n    *   performs lexical analysis\n    *   performs syntactical analysis\n4. Explain why subroutines are easier [1]\n    *   Can be **written** independently\n    *   Can be **tested** independently\n    *   Can be used many times\n5. Compare internal and external sorting\n    *   internal sorting methods allow a set of data to be sorted by loading data into primary memory and applying sorting algorithm there\n    *   external sorting is needed when the data is too large for the available primary memory space\n    *   sorting takes place by loading subsets of the data into primary memory to be sorted\n6. Outline differences between a compiler and an interpreter\n    *   an interpreter converts a single instruction to machine code before execution takes place\n    *   a compiler creates a separate machine code version of the entire program while an interpreter does not\n    *   to execute a compiled program, the compiler does not need to be in the primary memory while the execution of an interpreted program requires the interpreter to be located in the primary memory at all times\n    *   with a compiler, a program only needs to be translated once, whereas with an interpreter it needs to translate every time used\n7. Identify features of a computer language\n    *   fixed vocabulary\n    *   unambiguous meaning\n    *   consistent grammar and syntax\n    *   provide a way to define basic data types and operations on those types (ability to write functions/procedures)\n    *   provide the ability to to I/O handling\n    *   has to be able to be run/processed on computer\n8.

Compare the use of a linked list with an array to store an process the daily sales in a business [3]\n    *   size/length of a static array is predetermined/fixed, and the size of a linked list can be changed, it depends on the memory available\n    *   Linked list can be expanded to suite the daily sales\n    *   Each item in a static array can be directly accessed whilst access to the items in linked list is sequential\n    *   And searching for a given item in linked list is slower, as it cannot be searches for using binary search\n4. Explain benefits of using BST compared to stack when searching for a specific item [3]\n    *   Time efficiency\n        *   Data in BST is ordered\n        *   Such that as each node is checked for the item, half the remaining nodes are ignored\n        *   While all the elements in the stack have to be checked\n        *   So for large data sets, stacks may be inefficient as compared to BST\n    *   Memory efficiency\n        *   Each element on the stack has to be removed to be checked\n        *   When item is found, the stack’s contents will be changed\n        *   But when the element is found in the BST, the contents are not removed from the BST\n        *   So there is no need to create an additional copy of the BST, but a copy of a stack needs to be created\n5.

Compare a binary tree to a linked list in terms of searching and storage required [4]\n    *   A binary tree is faster and more efficient at searching as it can make use of **binary search**\n    *   A singly linked list is slower and less efficient as it is a **linear/sequential** data structure\n    *   More storage is required in a binary tree as it requires two pointers, and less storage is required for a singly linked list as it requires only one pointer\n7. Outline why recursive solutions can be memory intensive [2]\n    *   Recursive call involves use of stacks\n    *   For storing/pushing data\n    *   If many recursive calls are made, memory usage can be very large\n8.

Explain two functions that an operating system needs to perform in relation to multitasking [4]\n    *   Memory management:\n        *   OS allows more than one process to share memory\n        *   By allocating separate memory to each program\n        *   Provides memory isolation for each process\n    *   Processor management\n        *   To allow **appearance of more than one program running at the same time**\n        *   By allocation of time slices\n        *   Decides which process runs at a certain point in time\n        *   Arranges the execution of applications so that you believe that there are several things happening at once\n        *   Prioritizes tasks by importance\n3. Describe how memory management of an OS prevents the system from crashing when more than one program is run at the same time [2]\n    *   OS allocates and deallocates specific sections of memory to each program/module\n    *   Ensures that the memory assigned to one program is not overwritten\n    *   Uses secondary/virtual memory to allow more processes to run simultaneously\n4. Outline the use of paging in relation to virtual memory [2]\n    *   Paging allows similar-sized sections of data\n    *   Identified by specific addresses\n    *   To be swapped between RAM and secondary memory/storage\n5. Explain the consequences of 1GB RAM on a multimedia game laptop [3]\n    *   Software required more RAM to run efficiently\n    *   Paging would be regularly used\n    *   In order to load required
