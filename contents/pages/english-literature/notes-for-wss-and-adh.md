# Role of women



*   At the end of ADH, Torvald asks Nora: “Weren’t you happy?”; it never struck him that although she is safe and secure, that she might not be happy (no personal happiness)
*   Similarly, in WSS, Antoinette married even though she did not want to, but she finally succumbs to her promised
*   This shows us that il that time, women were **not given much freedom** to express their **emotions**, especially in their marital relationship
*   But today, the situations has greatly improved
    *   Furthermore, the emotions expressed are not isolated and personal (they are not only felt by the character), they are universal and felt by everyone, so we as readers/audience can relate.
*   In these stories, the authors are exploring whether the women were happy in their marital relationship
*   Rochester did not appeal to Antoinette emotionally, so was she justified in going mad with him?
    *   Furthermore, she was neglected by her mother at quite an early age
    *   Antoinette has been through a lot more than Nora, so their notions of happiness are a lot different
        *   Both react differently because of their different lifestyles
        *   Both were expected to get happiness from conventional sources (marriage) and are let down in different ways
    *   However, Nora is the only one who had the agency to act and improve herself; she is an iconoclast (similar to Kristine)
    *   That fact that Nora leaves shows **modernism** (modernism vs gothic fiction)


# Doll



*   In both the novels the man characters are referred to or similar to dolls
*   At the end of Part 2, Antoinette’s husband refers to her as a Doll 
    *   This **objectifies** her as an **inanimate** object, and he fails to see her emotions
    *   However, sometimes her emotions were cryptic as it was quite difficult to understand her
    *   It could have been easier for him to think of her as a doll, an inanimate object as he was unable to understand her as they had different perspectives and were born and brought up in different conditions
    *   Through the play she loses identity: first she has an identity as Antoinette, then her identity is stolen when she is named Bertha, then finally she loses her identity when she is dehumanized as a Doll
    *   She has become someone who can be controlled by the whims and fancies of an **unnamed** person (irony)
    *   She has no agency and no power, and the law cannot help them, hence she is reduced to a Doll, something which is **controlled** by the owner
    *   Similarly, her mother was also reduced to the doll as the Black man was kissing her before she died
        *   Mr Mason also treated her like a doll as he never through her worried about Pierre were true, and he never cared about her problems
        *   The death of Pierre did not make a difference to him
*   Nora in ADH is also referred to as Doll as her life and actions are controlled by Torvald
    *   She is restricted in her actions, and for example, she never leaves the house without him, she isn't allowed into Helmer’s study, she has to dance when Helmer wants him to, she is condescended by Helmer’s names
    *   However, through the course of the play, unlike Antoinette, she breaks out of the Doll as she gains agency, and finally has the power to make her own decision


# Paper



*   In both stories, paper plays an important role as a catalyst as it leads to a major turning point
    *   In _A Doll’s House_, paper holds proof on the crime Nora committed
    *   In _Wide Sargasso Sea,_ Daniel Cosway sends a letter to Rochester which confirms his suspicions and leads to his distrust of her


# Dreams



*   Dreams in both, although more prevalent and rich in WSS
*   ADH: husband will save her, be her hero and take the blame to save her
    *   She als “dreams”/nightmares that she will have to commit suicide if her things are spilled and cannot get better (to distance herself from the children)


# Clothes



*   in ADH, clothes are linked to the objectification of Nroa by Torvald (the tarantella)
*   In WSS, the dress is a symbol of friendship and money, something Tia stole from Antoinette
*   The removal of the dress in ADH leads to Nora’s empowerment, while it does not lead to agency in Wide Sargasso Sea


# Marriage and isolation



*   Women are confined from the society as they are controlled by men in both stories
*   The **sea** is a symbol to **isolation** in Wide Sargasso Sea


# Disease



*   Antoinette’s husband thinks that Antoinette’s disease is inherited from the mother (insanity)
*   In _A Doll’s House_, Dr. Rank has a transmitted disease
