    *   there were no basic impurities in the (x) that would react with (y)
3. How can you determine who all the hydrated salt has been converted into anhydrous form? [1]
    *   by repeating the process of heating and **weighing until a constant mass** is obtained (for accurate results it will be necessary to cool the sample to room temperature before each weighing)

# Atomic structure



1. Differentiate between a continuous spectrum and a line spectrum
    *   continuous spectrum: radiation spread over all frequencies
    *   line spectrum: radiation absorbed/emitted at certain/specific frequencies
2. Outline how the spectra of light from stars can be used to detect the presence of carbon [1]
    *   Presence of dark/absorption lines to corresponding to those found for carbon
    *   Missing wavelength/frequencies correspond to carbon’s spectrum
3. What do isotopes have in common?
    *   same atomic number
    *   same chemical properties because same number of electrons
    *   (different physical properties because different number of neutrons)
4. Explain how the successive ionization energies in sodium are related to the electron configuration
    *   the first ionization energy is the **lowest** as it corresponds to removing the electron in the valence level that is furthest from the nucleus and experiences the **least electrostatic attraction** (there is also some repulsion from other electrons)
    *   the IE of the second electron is much larger as it involves removing an electron that is in an **energy level closer to the nucleus** and experiences a greater electrostatic attraction
    *   as successive electrons are removed within the level, IEs increase due to the **greater effective nuclear charge** experienced by these electrons
    *   the large increase in the 9th and 10th IEs is due the the 10th electron being removed removed from the energy level closest to to the nucleus, where it will experience significant electrostatic attraction to the nucleus
    *   the 11th electron has the highest IE as it is also removed from the energy level **closest to the nucleus and experiences the greatest electrostatic attraction to the nucleus** (it’s the final electron is only experiences attraction to nucleus and no repulsion to other electrons, as the 10th one has already been removed)
5. Explain why noble gases show the highest first ionization energies respective to their periods
    *   the outer energy level is full
    *   there is an increased charge on the on the nucleus
    *   they have the greatest attraction for electrons and the effective nuclear charge is the highest for their electrons
6. Explain why the relative atomic mass of argon is greater than that of potassium, even through the atomic number of potassium is greater than that of argon
    *   argon has a greater number of heavier isotopes
    *   argon has a greater number of neutrons
    *   (potassium has more protons than argon, so it has a higher atomic number; argon has a higher atomic mass as there is a higher abundance of heavier isotopes that contain more neutrons than potassium)
7. Describe the bonding within the carbon monoxide molecule
    *   triple covalent bond molecule
    *   one electron pair donated by oxygen to carbon atom (coordinate covalent compound)
8. The graph of ionization energies of aluminium is shown. Explain why there is a large increase between the 9th and 10th ionization energies
    *   the 9th IE corresponds to the following: Al<sup>8+</sup> → Al<sup>9+</sup> + e<sup>−</sup>
    *   from Al<sup>8+</sup> the electron is removed from the 2p orbital
    *   from Al<sup>9+</sup> the electron is removed from the 2s orbital
    *   electrons in a 2s orbital are of a lower energy, and closer to the nucleus and experience a stronger force of electrostatic attraction and so are more difficult to remove

1. This question is about the hydrogen spectrum
    1. Describe the appearance of the visible **emission spectrum **of hydrogen [2]
        *   Line spectrum
        *   Lines converge at high energy/frequency
    2. Explain how this spectrum is related to the electron energy levels in a hydrogen atom [3]
        *   Electron transition from higher to lower/second energy levels
        *   Each transition causes emission of light of specific wavelength/energy
        *   Each transition is related to energy difference
        *   Energy levels in hydrogen atom are closer/converge at higher energy


# Periodicity



1. Explain why noble gases have the highest first ionization energies
    *   the electrons experience the greatest effective nuclear charge
    *   so the valence electrons experience the greatest electrostatic force of attraction to the nucleus
2. Explain why chlorine has a smaller atomic radius than sodium
    *   valence electrons of both are 󠀭󠀭in third shell so they experience similar shielding effects
    *   chlorine has 17 p and sodium has 11 p so valence electrons of chlorine will experience a greater attraction to the nucleus and be held closer to nuclear so smaller atomic radius
    *   The effective nuclear charge of chlorine is higher as it has more protons, so the electrons in the outer energy level are pulled closer by the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the electrons
3. Explain why S<sup>2−</sup> has a greater ionic radius that Cl<sup>−</sup>
    *   sulfide has 16 p and chloride has 17 p
    *   sulfide’s valence electrons in outer energy level experience **less attraction** from the nucleus and will be held less closely, resulting in a larger ionic radius
4. Explain why there are relatively large differences between the 4th and 5th, and between the 10th and 11th ionization energies
    *   4th electron removed from 3d and 5th electron removed from 3p
    *   10th electron removed from 3p and 11th electron removed from 3s
    *   Electrons removed from lower energy level (closer the nucleus) are attracted more strongly
    *   **Electrons closer to the nucleus also have a greater effective nuclear charge**
5. Explain why Ni<sup>2+</sup> is green but Sc<sup>3+</sup> is colorless
    *   Color is due to partially filled d sub-level
    *   d sub-level is split
    *   Ni<sup>2+</sup> has incomplete 3d sub-level but Sc<sup>3+</sup> has no 3d electrons
    *   Electrons move from lower to higher sub-levels when they absorb energy/light
    *   Ni<sup>2+</sup> appears green because it absorbs red
6. Explain what is meant by a transition metal [1]
    *   Incomplete d sub-level in its compounds/ions

1. Explain why melting points of
    1. Group 1 elements decrease down the group
        *   metallic bond strength decreases down the group as delocalized valence electrons are in energy levels more distant from the nucleus
        *   higher distance between nucleus and delocalized electrons so less bond strength
    2. Group 17 increase down the group
        *   exist as diatomic molecules attracted by weak London forces
        *   they increase down the group as the atoms become larger and contain more electrons so higher melting points (bigger electron cloud increases the LDF as there is an increased probability of temporary dipoles forming)


# Chemical bonding and structure



1. Given two white solids, find out which one is an ionic compound
    *   test the mp: ionic solids usually have high melting points
    *   test the solubility: ionic compounds usually dissolve in water but not hexane
    *   test the conductivity: ionic compounds in aq solutions are good conductors, as are ionic compounds when they are molten
2. Why are double bonds shorter and stronger than single bonds?
    *   multiple bonds have a greater number of shared electrons and so have a stronger force of electrostatic attraction between the bonded nuclei
    *   there is a greater pulling power on the nuclei, bringing them closer together, resulting in bonds that are shorter and stronger than single bonds
3. What are the main ideas of the VSEPR theory?
    *   total no. of electron domains around the central atom determines the geometrical arrangement of the electron domains
    *   shape of the molecule is determined by angles between the bonded atoms
    *   repulsion applies to electron domains
    *   non-bonding pairs (lone pairs) have a higher concentration of charge than bonding pairs because they are not shared between two atoms, and so cause slightly more repulsive than bonding pairs
4. Describe the bonding in metals [2]
    *   electrostatic attraction
    *   between a lattice of metal positive ions/cations AND a sea of delocalized electrons
5. Suggest why the mp of vanadium is higher than that of titanium [1]
    *   vanadium has a smaller ionic radius leading to a stronger metallic bonding
6. Explain why an alloy is harder than the pure metal
    *   foreign atoms/ions distort the regular arrangement of atoms/ions or are of a **different size** to the pure atoms/ions
    *   this prevents layers from **sliding** over each other
7. Compare the structure and bonding in carbon dioxide and silicon dioxide [3]
    *   Structure: CO<sub>2</sub> molecular and SiO<sub>2</sub> three dimensional/giant covalent
    *   CO<sub>2</sub> linear and SiO<sub>2</sub> tetrahedral
    *   Intramolecular bonding: covalent bonds in CO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>
    *   Double bonds in CO<sub>2</sub> and single bonds in SiO<sub>2</sub>
8. Predict and explain whether NH<sub>3</sub> and BF<sub>3</sub> are polar molecules
    *   BF<sub>3</sub> is nonpolar as no net dipole; in BF<sub>3</sub> bond polarities cancel each other out/symmetrical distribution of charge
    *   NH<sub>3</sub> is polar as there is net dipole movement; N–H bond polarities do not cancel each other out/unsymmetrical distribution of charge (there is a lone pair, making it tetrahedral)
9. Describe the nature of ionic bonding [1]
    *   Electrostatic attraction AND oppositely charged ions
10. Explain resonance [1]
   *   More than one possible position for a multiple/π bond
11. Explain why x is more volatile than y (template question) [2]
    *   Hydrogen bonding in y
    *   Dipole-dipole forces in y are more polar
    *   C has greater molar mass/more dispersion/London/instantaneous induced dipole-induced dipole forces/van der Waal forces;

# Energetics and thermochemistry



1. Comment on the relative values of the first and second electron affinity values of (oxygen) as given in the data booklet [2]
    *   The first electron affinity corresponds to the attraction of an outer electron into the outer energy level of oxygen, which is an exothermic as heat is released
    *   The second electron affinity corresponds to a negatively charged oxide ion accepting an additional outer electron into an energy level despite the mutual repulsion between the negatively charged species, which is an endothermic process
2. Describe assumptions made using this expression (graph: temperature vs. time) to calculate heat changes
    *   all the heat released by the reaction is **transferred to the solution** and there is no heat loss to surroundings
    *   the **specific heat capacity** of the solution is equal to that of water
    *   the density of the solution is 1.00g/cm3 (same as water)
    *   the temperature changes occur uniformly thought the solution
    *   the polystyrene cup does not absorb any heat (it has negative heat capacity)
    *   the excess zinc powder does not absorb any heat (it has negligible heat capacity)
3. The heat graph is extrapolated to calculate the maximum temperature allowing for heat loss; state the assumption made.
    *   that the temperature decreases at a uniform rate (so linear extrapolation is appropriate)
4. The experiment is repeated and another value of enthalpy is obtained. Comment on these differences
    *   Heat to the atmosphere/surroundings
    *   The **specific heat capacity** is take of **pure water**, even though it might not be 
    *   The density of the solution taken to be that of pure water
    *   **Uncertainty of thermometer** is so high so temperature change is unreliable
    *   Not all solid dissolved

1. Why does the reaction
    1. Represent the bond enthalpy of HCL: HCl(g) → H(g) + Cl(g)
        *   bond enthalpy is the energy required to break 1 mole of a bond in gaseous molecule averaged over similar compounds
        *   the bond breaks with each atom taking on the bonded electron and no charged species being formed
        *   this equation shows the H–Cl bond being broken to give H(g) and Cl(g)
    2. Represent the C–Cl bond enthalpy in tetrachloromethane: CCL<sub>4</sub> → CCl<sub>3</sub>(g) + Cl(g)
        *   bond enthalpy is required to break 1 mole of a bond in a gaseous molecule averaged over similar compounds
        *   therefore the equation representing a bond enthalpy of the C–Cl bond should only involve the breaking of one C–Cl bond
2. Explain why the data booklet value of enthalpy of combustion differs from
    3. The theoretical value
        *   the enthalpy change calculated from the bond enthalpies are averaged values obtained from similar compounds and are not specific to the compounds in the reactions
        *   the tabulated bond enthalpies are also obtained from gaseous compounds but the combustion reactions conducted in the reactions uses liquid methanol
    4. The lab calculated value
        *   heat released from the reaction is lost to the surrounding air as well as going into heating the glass test-tube and is not all going into heating the water
        *   complete combustion might not occur in the lab, which would decrease the amount of heat released by the reactions
3. The following reactions take place in the ozone layer by the absorption of UV light
    5. State and explain, by reference to the bonding, which of the reactions required a shorter wavelength: I) O<sub>3</sub> → O<sub>2</sub> + O.; and II) O<sub>2</sub> → O. + O.
        *   the bond order in O<sub>2</sub> = 2; the bond order in O<sub>3</sub> = 1.5, because of the two resonance structures (coordinate bond)
        *   reaction II will require shorter wavelength as the bond in O<sub>2</sub> has a higher bond order and is stronger than the bonds in O<sub>3</sub>
        *   UV light of a higher energy (shorter wavelength) will be required to break the stronger bond in O<sub>2</sub>
    6. Explain why ozone can be decomposed by light with a longer wavelength than the required to decompose oxygen
        *   the oxygen double bond has a bond order of 2, stronger than the 1.5 bond order in ozone
        *   so less energy is required to dissociate ozone than oxygen
        *   longer wavelength radiation of lower energy is needed to dissociate ozone
4. State whether the the following reactions of the born-haber cycle are endothermic or exothermic
    7. ½ Cl<sub>2</sub> → Cl(g) and Li(s) → Li(g)
        *   bond dissociation and enthalpy of atomization
        *   so both endothermic
    8. Cl(g) + e<sup>−</sup> → Cl<sup>−</sup>(g) and Li(g) → Li<sup>+</sup>(g) + e<sup>−</sup>
        *   electron affinity is exothermic
        *   ionization energy is endothermic
    9. Li<sup>+</sup>(g) + Cl<sup>−</sup>(g) → LiCl(s)
        *   reverse lattice enthalpy is exothermic
        *   (otherwise, lattice enthalpy is endothermic)
    10. ½ Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) → Cl(g) and Cl(g) → Cl(g) + e<sup>−</sup> → Cl<sup>−</sup>(g)
       *   bond dissociation is endothermic
       *   electron affinity is exothermic
5. This is a question about the born-haber cycle
    11. The theoretically calculated value for lattice enthalpy of magnesium chloride is different from the experimental value explain
        *   theoretical values are calculated assuming that bonding in MgCl<sub>2</sub> is ionic in nature; however, the bond between Mg and Cl also has some **covalent character**
        *   this results in the experimental atomic enthalpy being higher than the theoretical lattice enthalpy
    12. Explain why magnesium oxide has a higher lattice enthalpy than magnesium chloride
        *   lattice enthalpy increases in magnitude with increasing charge of the ions in salt and with decreasing ionic radius
        *   for MgO, the ionic attraction is between 2+ and 2– ions, so this will result in a higher lattice enthalpy for MgCl<sub>2</sub> where the attraction is between 2+ and 2– ions
        *   the O<sup>2−</sup> ions also has a smaller ionic radius than Cl<sup>−</sup> so this results in a higher lattice enthalpy of MgO


# Chemical kinetics
