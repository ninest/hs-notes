# Causes of global climate change


## Structure of the Earth



*   Thermosphere
*   Atmosphere
*   Stratosphere
*   Troposphere


### Atmospheric energy balance



*   **Insolation** is incoming solar radiation
*   Most of this energy in the tropical regions, whereas there is a loss in energy from poles
*   There is a redistribution of energy from lower altitudes to higher latitudes by wind circulation and ocean currents
*   Only 46% of energy is absorbed at the surface


### Atmospheric energy balance



*   There are three types of heat transfer
    *   Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves
    *   Convection is the transfer of heat by movement of gas or liquid
    *   Conduction is the transfer of heat by contact
*   Of **46%** of the insolation reaches the earth's atmosphere
*   Reflection from the earth's surface is known as **planetary albedo** 
*   Energy received from the Sun by the Earth is re-radiate at a long wavelength


### Incoming (short-wave) radiation



*   **Insolation** is the main energy out, and it affected by latitude, season, and cloud cover
    *   The less cloud cover, the more radiation reaches the Earth’s surface
*   Short-wave radiation is not absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, they only heat up the Earth, which then predicted long-wave radiation


### Long-wave radiation



*   **Long-wave radiation** refers to the radiation of energy from the Earth (cold body) into the atmosphere
*   During the day, outgoing long-wave radiation transfer is greater than the incoming long-wave transfer, so there is a net loss of energy
*   On a cloudy night, clouds return some long-wave radiation to the surface, which reduced the overall loss of energy


## The greenhouse effect



*   The **greenhouse effect** is the process by which certain gases allow short-wave radiation from the Sun to pass through the atmosphere but trap an increasing proportion of outgoing long-wave radiation from the Earth


### Greenhouse gases



*   Water vapour: accounts for 50% of the greenhouse effect
*   Carbon dioxide: from deforestation, as it removed tres that convert carbon dioxide to oxygen
*   Methane: from cattle, wetlands
*   Chlorofluorocarbons: destroy ozone


## Changes in the global energy balance


### Variations in solar radiation



*   Changes in the output of energy from the sun (11-year cycle)
*   Small variations in the Earth's orbit affect the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation (responsible for ice ages)
*   Changes in atmospheric composition are linked to an increase in global temperature
*   Changes in **albedo**, as the ice melts and is replaced by darker vegetation


### Global dimming



*   Air pollution has a cooling effect
*   Natural particles in clean air provide condensation nuclei for water, and polluted air contains more particles than clean air, and therefore many more states for water to bind to
*   The droplets are smaller than natural ones, meaning polluted clouds conant smaller water droplets, and hence reflect more sunlight, presenting the Sun’s heat from getting through the Earth's surface


### Feedback loops



1. Positive feedback
    *   Ice caps
        *   Melting of polar ice caps = lower albedo
        *   Less ice = less reflection of radiation
        *   So more energy absorbed, hence an increase in temperature
    *   Melting ice and water
        *   Melt Ice ice = more water = bigger waves
        *   Larger waves break up sea ice
        *   Water is less reflective, so more energy absorbed, hence an increase in temperature
    *   Permafrost
        *   Thawing of permafrost = increase in methane levels
        *   Adding to the GHGs
        *   So increase in temperature because heat is prevented from leaving
2. Negative feedback
    *   Burning, leading to more aerosols, and reduced solar radiation, causing cooling (global dimming)
    *   Increased evaporation, leading to more cooling

Case study: negative feedback in Greenland


## Enhanced greenhouse effect



*   The **enhanced greenhouse effect** is the impact of increasing levels of greenhouse gases as a result of human activities, often referred to as **global warming**
*   The increase in the world's greenhouse gases is linked to industrialization, trade, and globalization


# Consequences of global climate change


## Implications



*   Sea-level rise: floods to low-lying areas such as the Maldives, and Bangladesh
*   Storm activity increase
*   Agricultural patterns change: USA’s grain belt will shrink and production will decline, while Canada's goriing season will get longer and more productive
*   Less rainfall over the USA, southern Europe, and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
*   Up to **40%** of wildlife species will go extinct in the Amazon, Miombo woodlands of South Africa (African elephants, sundarban tigers, and also sea-animals such as sharks)


### Hydrosphere



*   Rise in sea-levels flooding low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, Netherlands, Egypt, displacing over 200 million people
    *   Water expands in heat, leading to a higher increase in sea-level, of from 40–80 cm
*   Floods from melting glaciers treating over 4 M km<sup>2</sup> of land


### Case study: climate change impacts on the UK



*   Temperature rise of 1.5–4.5ºC
*   Sea-level rise by 20–40 cm (around 3 mm per year, as predicted by the government)
*   Trees: deciduous trees would replace conifers
*   Plants: crocuses and daffodils would only grow in the north; maize will only grow in the south
*   Birds: Arctic species such as Snow bunting and Dotterel will face extinction; Greenshank and Dunlin under threat
*   Flooding defences to be rebuilt in low-lying areas: Kent, East Angelica
*   More heat waves, like those in 2003, which killed over 2000 people in the UK: they are expected to become the norm by the 2040s
*   Vector-borne diseases: more risks from new and emerging pests and diseases
    *   The higher temperatures extends the range of certain insects and pests
    *   Milder, lower temperature, winters also increase the survival rate of these pests


### Changes in sea ice



*   Melting season of Arctic increase
*   As sea ice recedes, potential for wave formation reduces
*   Larger waves help break up sea ice, establishing positive feedback of disappearing sea ice and wave formation
    *   In 2012, a 5-meter wave was recorded in the Beaufort Sea
*   Methane emissions from tundra will increase because 
*   Polar bears have less time to hunt seal, and must spend more time on land
    *   There is also a reduced body size, and decreased reproductive success


### Glaciers and ice caps



*   The Himalayan glaciers are retreating
    *   This may have a major impact on the region’s water supply (the Hindu Kush Himalayan region; glacier treatment could water shortages for up to 1.5 B people)
*   Combined with other factors such as population growth and high density of population, this issue is made worse


### Case study: retreat of Swiss glaciers



*   The Swiss Alps declined from 1,800 km<sup>2</sup> in 1850 to 1,300 km<sup>2</sup> in 1972, a loss of ⅓ of the surface area
*   The glacier changed substantially between 1882 and 2015
    *   In 1882, it was 15 km long
    *   Between 1883 and 1885, it grew slowly, around 4 km; it remained steady for a few years
    *   It then repeated 26 m/yr for the next couple of years
    *   By 1920, it was retreating 10 m/yr
    *   Annual rates increase  in the 1920s
    *   In 2007–8, it retreated drastically, a total of 290 m
*   It has retreated over 2.5 km over the last 130 years due to global warming
*   Problems include
    *   Economic: loss of homes and tourism (tourist guides and ski hotels lose tourists and hence income)
    *   Social: less tourists arrive, tribes and displaced people must migrate
    *   Environmental: loss of habitat and biomes as the alps receded for animals such as the Alpine ibex and Chamois


## Changes in carbon stored in ice, oceans, and biosphere



*   Before the industrial revolution, the amount of ice stored on land, in oceans, and in the biosphere was balanced, but human activity has tipped the balance
*   Before the industrial revolution, the carbon concentration would only change through
    *   Volcanic eruptions
    *   Sea-floor spreading
*   In the 1990s, human activity added 8.0 PgC, 6.4 of which acme from burning fossil fuels
    *   The oceans absorbed 28% and the land 32%, the rest remaining in the atmosphere 
*   But in 2000–8, human activity added 9.1 PgC to the atmosphere annually, 7.7 PgC from fossil fuels and 1.4 PgC from deforestation and land -use change 


### Oceans



*   More carbon increases warms the atmosphere and makes plants grow faster and store more carbon
*   An increased carbon in the atmosphere has lead to more dissolving in the oceans
    *   This endangers much marine life, especially shell-building animals as the acids dissolve and weaken the shells (weaken the carbonates of crabs and lobsters, and they end up with thinner shells)
    *   The pH of water has dropped by 0.1 since 1750
*   Warmer oceans decrease the abundance of phytoplankton, which grow more vigorously in cool, nutrient-rich waters such 


### Biosphere



*   With the doubling carbon dioxide, plant growth increases by 12–76%
*   Many forests are cleared for agricultural zones
    *   However, if farmland is abandoned, such as in **Montserrat**, the vegetation ma revert to forest
    *   By preventing wildfires, humans prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere, and instead it builds up in plants
        *   Therefore, the use of fire to create new farmland releases considerable amounts of carbon into the atmosphere


### Ice



*   Permafrost contain large deposits of carbon, accumulate over thousands of years
*   The low temperature reduces the rate of decomposition of organic plant matter, leading an accumulation of dead organic matter
*   Warming of the peric glacier environments will lead to increased methane emissions
*   Decreases show reduced reflectivity of the surface, increasing the absorption of solar radiation (positive feedback)


## Changes in biomes



*   Low-lying biomes such sa **mangroves** may be lost as a result of changes in sea level
*   Climate change in the past has happened over long periods of time, allowing animals to adapt gradually to new conditions
    *   Current increases in temperature are happening very rapidly, so there is less time for organisms to adapt
    *   Organisms will either have to migrate or go extinct if they’re unable to adapt


### Changes to agriculture



*   Northward shift of wheat-growing in North America
*   More difficult to irrigate fields due to limited water resources


## Impact of climate change on people and places



*   Organisms-based diseases such as malaria: new hotter conditions are better for mosquitoes to breed
*   Migration due to changes in sea-level causes environmental-refugees
*   Changes in tourism
    *   Extended summers, which o=is good for coastal resorts in North America
    *   Winter sports stopped due to lack of snow (in Aviemore, an in the Alps)
    *   Reduced precipitation makes some locations economic due to water shortage


### Social



*   Hunger and conflict


# Responding to climate change


## Disparities in exposure



*   **Exposure** is the degree to which people are exposed to climate change
*   **Sensitivity** is the degree to which people could be harmed by exposure to climate change
*   **Adaptive capacity** is the degree to which they could mitigate the potential harm by taking action to reduce their exposure or sensitivity
*   Certain **populations** are more **vulnerable** than others: the very young, elderly, disabled, poor, minority groups, refugees, and indigenous people
*   Certain **locations** are more **vulnerable** than others: low-lying islands, river mouths, valleys, coastal areas, regions deriving water supplies from mountain glaciers; therefore they face
    *   Increased coastal erosion
    *   Saline intrusion into groundwater supplies
    *   Deterioration of coral reefs
    *   Out-migration of people
    *   Loss of income due to a decline in economic activities and infrastructure


## Case study: Flooding in Bangladesh



*   Most of Bangladesh lives along a delta formed by **three rivers** (**the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra**), which periodically flood the land
    *   This is essential as it naturally irrigate the crops and increases soil fertility
    *   However, since 1970, the scale, impact, and duration of these floods has increased, and there are still scientific prediction that it will continue increasing
    *   A rise in temperatures of **2.6ºC** will lead to widespread repeated flooding
    *   Due to **sea-level rise**, the densely populated coastal zone of Bangladesh is also increasingly vulnerable to coastal floods
*   The flood damage is worsening due to the increased intensity of extreme precipitation events and the **14-40%** increase in monsoon rainfalls by the 2030s
    *   Since 1990, the frencuney of extreme precipitation has increased in Narayanpur island as normal floods have become more catastrophic
        *   Fewer than 1% can reach medical help within 1 hour as there is no suitable transport for those living by the indian border
        *   People often have to sell assets post a flood to buy food and equipment
*   Government and non-government organizations have been involved in reducing the impacts of flooding in Bangladesh
    *   In 1988, after the most severe floodings of the 20th century, the government developed the **Flood Action Plan**
        *   Sluice gates were built on a number of rivers, which provided protection from flooding by tidal waves and storm surges
    *   5,700 km of embankments were also built
    *   Neary 5,000 km of drainage channels were built
    *   200 flood shelters on stilts for equation of people threatened by floods
        *   Watch has brick toilets and septic tanks to reduce water contamination
*   Impacts of the flood include
    *   Personal security
        *   Deaths from drowning, diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid
        *   Loss of income
        *   Loss or unavailability of fuelwood
    *   Buildings and infrastructure
        *   Tin-wall and mud houses washed away
        *   Damage to temples, and factories
    *   Crops and animals
        *   Loss of livestock
        *   Grain shortages
        *   Damage to vegetation


## Case study: Vulnerability and adaptation in Ghana



*   In Ghana in West Africa, there are a number of adaptations include
    *   Infrastructure development: building dams, levees, and seawalls
    *   Ecosystem-based measures: preserving and restoring natural habitats such as mangrove swamps
    *   Capacity development: education and to teach people new techniques and to empower people
*   There are different impacts and adaptations in different zones
    *   Northern Savanna
        *   Increased morbidity and disease prevalence
        *   Increased vulnerability of the poor
        *   Increased out-mediation and loss of human capital
    *   Forest
        *   Decreased food security 
        *   Dry-ups of water bodies and underground water
        *   Population pressure on land
    *   Coastal Savanna
        *   Decreased water availability and quality
        *   Higher burden on women
        *   Increased migration
        *   Increased cholera


## Government-led action


### The UN Framework Concentration on climate change (1992)



*   The objective was to prevent GHGs in the atmosphere to grow to dangerous levels
*   It went into effect in 1994, but failed
*   The **Kyoto Protocol (1997)** was the first major attempt to implement the treaty
    *   HICs were required to cut carbon emissions by 20% by 2012 compared to the 1990 emissions
    *   The US didn't sign while Canada and Australia did
