# D.1 Geophysical systems


## Mechanisms of plate movement



*   Plates move through **convection currents** of the circular motion of the hot molten lava
*   **Subduction** refers to the plunging of one plate beneath another: the heavier, denser oceanic plate subducted under the lighter continental plate, and magma exits the mantle in the process
*   Constructive plate boundaries: when two plates move away from each other, land is created as magma rises to fill the gap
*   When this magma solidifies, land is formed
*   Rifting occurs at constructive plate boundaries

## Earthquakes



*   An **earthquake** is a series of seismic vibrations or shock waves which originate from the **focus**
    *   The **focus** is the point at which the quakes release their tension or compression suddenly
    *   The **epicenter** is the point on the surface of the earth immediately above the **focus** of the earthquake
*   There are **shallow-deep earthquakes** (occur close to ground surface) and **deep-focus earthquakes** (occur at considerable depth)
*   A large earthquake can be preceded by smaller tremors known as **foreshocks** and followed by numerous **aftershocks**

</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>


### Earthquakes and plate boundaries



*   Earthquakes are caused by the pressure created by moving plates, this increases stress on rocks, the rocks deform and eventually snap
*   The snapping releases energy (earthquake)


### Human triggers



*   Some earthquakes occur a long way from any plate boundary as a result of human activity
*   In **Denver, Colorado, 1960**, waste water contaminated by chemical warfare agents were injected into underlying rocks
    *   From 1962–5, over 700 minor earthquakes were reported although no real damage was caused
    *   The injection of this water lubricated and reactivated underground faults which had been inactive
*   Fracking involves injecting water into rocks at high pressures, and has been associated with triggering earthquakes in the UK – in 2011, it led to a 2.3 in Lancashire
*   The weight of water behind large reservoirs also created earthquake, such as in 1935, the Colorado river was dammed by the Hoover dam to create Lake Mead
    *   The underlying rocks had an increased load, causing 6,000 earthquake in the next 10 years, although none caused damage

## Mass movements



*   Mass movements include any large-scale movement of the Earth’s surface that are not accompanied by a moving agent such as a river, glaciers, or ocean waves, including
    *   Soil creep (slow)
    *   Avalanches (very fast)
    *   Rockfalls (dry)
    *   Mudflows (fluid)
*   The processes affecting magnitude, frequency, and scale of mass movements are
    *   Type of movement: flows, slides, slumps
    *   Speed of movement
    *   Water content
    *   Material
    *   Slope/gravity 


### Causes of mass movements



*   Shear strength: a reduction in internal resistance of the slope
*   Shear stress: increase in forces attempting to pull a mass downslope

Table: Increasing and decreasing resistance

Case study: Neap landslide, 2015



*   Factors that trigger landslides include
    *   Seasonal rainfall
    *   Road construction
    *   Slopes weakened by previous slides
*   These factors contributed to the landslides during the Gorkha earthquake of April 2015
*   One of the largest was an ice and rock landslide at Langtang
*   The vertical distance was 700–800 m and the horizontal distance was 2–3 km


# D.2 Geophysical hazard risks


## Spatial distribution of geophysical hazard events


### Earthquakes



*   There are clearly defined linear patterns
    *   Linear chain follow plate boundaries,
    *   the center of the Atlantic Ocean
    *   around the Pacific Ocean: the Ring of Fire
*   Broad belts of earthquakes are associated with subduction zones, whereas narrow belts of earthquakes are associated with constructive plate margins (new material is forming, plates move apart)
*   Collision boundaries, such as the Himalayas, are associated with broad belts of earthquakes; conservative plate boundaries, such as California's SA fault line, give a relatively narrow belt of earthquakes


### Volcanoes



*   Most are found at plate boundaries, although there are some exceptions
    *   These include Hawaii, which occur over hotspots
    *   A **hotspot** or **mantle plume** (a jet of hot material rising from the deep within a mantle) is responsible for the volcanoes
    *   Hotspots play a role in the formation of new land
*   Around ¾ of the Earth’s 550 historically active volcanoes lie along the Pacific Ring of Fire 
    *   It also includes many of the world’s most recent volcanoes such as Mt Pinatubo (Philippines), Mt Unzen (Japan), Mt Agung (Java)
    *   Caused by the subduction beneath either oceanic or continental crust
    *   Subduction in the oceans provides chains of volcanic islands known island arcs, such as the **Aleutian islands** formed by the Pacific subducting beneath the North American Plate
    *   The subduction of an oceanic crust occur beneath the continental crust, and young fold mountains are formed, such as **The Andes**, which have been formed where the Nazca subducts beneath the South American plate.
*   Other area of active vulcanicity include Iceland, Montserrat in the Caribbean
*   Some submarine volcanoes such as Kick ‘em Jenny off Grenda in the Caribbean are monitored 
*   Although deeper levels of the Earth are much hotter than the surface, rocks are not molten as the pressure is too high
    *   There is molten rock along the plate boundaries, which feeds the volcanoes


### Landslides



*   Naturally occurring phenomena in every environment including the tropics, temperature readings, high latitudes, and the ocean
*   Fatal landslides tend to be more common in areas that have
    *   Active tectonic processes that lead to high rates of uplift and occasional seismic events
    *   High levels of precipitation, including high annual totals and high short-term intestines
    *   A high population density
*   The most fatal landslides occur in Ncis where the migration schemes are less likely in place
    *   Southern edge of Himalayan edge
    *   Central China
    *   South-west India
    *   Central Indonesia, the island of Java
    *   The caribbean and central Mexico
    *   Western edge of South America, especially Columbia


## The relevance of hazard magnitude and frequency/recurrence intervals for risk management 



*   The **recurrence interval**/**return period** is the expected frequency in years for an event of aprtoucialr size
    *   In general, small events have a high frequency/short return period, whereas large events have a very low frequency/high return period
    *   There are fewer highly destructive earthquakes, but many minor ones
    *   Low-frequency and high-magnitude events cause the most destruction and require the greatest management
    *   People are able to **adapt** and become less vulnerable to high-frequency disasters such as smaller earthquakes


### Earthquake frequency and magnitude



*   Instead of the Richter scale, scientists are increasingly using the **Movement MAgnitude Scale (M)** which measure the amount of energy released


### Measuring volcanoes



*   Measured by the **Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)**, based on the amount of material ejected in the explosion, the height of the cloud created, and the amount of damage caused


## Geophysical hazard risk as a product of economic, social, demographic, and political factors

In general, LICs are more vulnerable than industrialized countries due to the following reasons

Why do people live in hazard-prone places?



*   **Behavioural school**: environmental hazards are the result of natural hazards, and people put themselves at risk by living on or at the foot of steep slopes
*   **Structuralist school**: constraints places on poor people by prevailing social and political system of the country; poor people live in unsafe conditions, such as the slope of a hill because they are prevented from living in better areas
*   The concept of **vulnerability** includes not only the physical effects of a natural hazard, but also the status of people and property in the affected area


### Economic factors



*   **Levels of wealth and development**: in 1976, Guatemala, 20,000 people were killed by low-quality housing in ravines and gorges; this earthquake had a markedly class impact
*   **Construction styles and building codes**: In Sichuan 2008, following the 7.9 earthquake, government buildings remained standing while many schools were destroyed, suggesting that they were poorly build
*   **Access to technology**: in Japan, earthquake and tsunami warnings are issued to people via smartphones; people with greater access to communications are able to keep up to date with warnings and forecast 
*   **Insurance cover**: the poor have no insurance, and are most likely to be affected in natural hazards as their housing quality is poor


###### Social factors



*   **Education**: gives people higher income, better housing, greater understanding of nature and hazard events
*   **Public education**: programs in Japan have helped reduce the number of deaths
*   **Awareness of hazards**
*   **Gender**: women are often carers, and are unable to leave an area even if they want to


### Demographic factors



*   **Population density**: large urban areas, such as **Port-au-Prince** in Haiti are vulnerable to natural hazards
*   **Age**: 65% of deaths in Japan tsunami 2011 where aged over 60
*   **Migrants**: migrants may be unaware of some natural hazards present in an environment
*   **Disability**: mortality rate of disabled in Japan tsunami 2011 was twice that or normal population
*   **Cultural factors**: extend of train in governments, more


### Political factors



*   **Nature of the society**: the failure of the Burmese government increased the number of deaths from disease and malnutrition in the cyclone Nargis in 2008
*   **Effectiveness of lines of communication**: the Sichuan earthquake of 2008 got a swift response and mobilized 100,000 troops
*   **Availability and readiness of emergency personnel**: fewer deaths from Mt Pinatubo eruption as the USGS had minitoed the volcano closely


## Geographical factors affecting the impacts of geophysical events



*   **Magnitude and frequency of events**: shallow-focus earthquakes are potentially more damaging that deep-focus earthquakes (overlying rocks absorb most of the energy)
*   **Population density**: a geophysical hazard hitting an urban area could inflict more damage to an urbanized area such as Tokyo
    *   The 1985 8.0 Mexico city earthquake occurred in the city and killed around 5,000 people
*   **Type of buildings**: HICs have better earthquake-resistant buildings, and people are more likely to have insurance cover than in LICs 
*   **Time of the day**: earthquakes at busy times such as peak hours cause more deaths (this is less of a factor for volcanoes as they do not have a sudden onset)
    *   The Sichuan 2008 earthquake 7,9 occurred at 14:00 pm, and ended up killing many school children too
*   **Types of rocks and sediments**: liquefaction occurs when loose material is shaken, so buildings built on solid rock are much safer
    *   The Casita volcano in Nicaragua caused landslides due to the unconsolidated volcanic sediments
*   **Secondary hazards**: these can often cause more fatalities than the original event (tsunamis, fires, contaminated water, disease, hunger, hypothermia)
    *   More people died due to lahars following the Pinatubo 1991 eruption than the volcanic eruption
*   **Economic development**: HICs generally have a better level of preparedness and emergency response

# Hazard risk and vulnerability


## Vulnerability



*   **Vulnerability** are the characteristics and circumstances of a community, system, or asset that make it susceptible to damaging effects of a hazard
*   It is related to many factors:
    *   **Physical factors**: poor design, construction, unregulated land use
    *   **Social factors**: poverty and inequality – these groups are more vulnerable
    *   **Economic factors**: those in the uninsured, informal sector, workers facing economic pressures are more vulnerable
    *   **Environmental factors**: poor environmental management, overconsumption of natural resources
*   Vulnerability explains how non-extreme hazards can lead to extreme impacts (due to factors above)


## Risk



*   **Risk** is the likelihood of loss of life, injury, or destruction and damage from a disaster in a given period of time
*   Disaster risk = consequence of the interaction between **hazards** and characteristics that make people **vulnerable** and **exposed**
*   Managing risks is shared across a wide range of sectors:
    *   Insurance sector: recovery from disaster losses
    *   Construction sector: so that buildings are built according to disaster codes
    *   Land-use and urban planning sectors: locations of new developments takes into account the likelihood of a hazard event

# Future resilience and adaptation



*   This topic deals with the preparedness of various places to the hazard events


## Global geophysical hazard disaster trends and future predictions



*   Geophysical hazard frequency between 1994 and 2013 has remained relatively constant, while population growth and economic development has varied considerably and increased
*   LICs bear a disproportionate burden to national disasters, including disparities in **death rates**
*   Between 1994 and 2013, an average of **218 million** people were affected by natural disasters every year, and **1.35 million** people died, resulting in an annual average of **68,000 deaths**


### Megadiasasters



*   A **mega disaster** is an event that kills more than 100,000 people. Some megasisaters between 1994–2013 are:
    *   The **Asian tsunami 2004**, 225,000 in 12 counties
    *   The **Cyclone Nargis 2008**, 138,000 in Myanmar
    *   The **Haiti earthquake 2004**, 220,000
*   Earthquakes and tsunamis are rarer than floods but cause higher number of casualties in shorter periods of time
*   Urbanization within highly seismic zones has increased significantly over recent decades
    *   Slums and squatter settlements frequently expand onto high-risk areas such as slopes and embankments due to the lack of any other suitable places
    *   In Haiti, there were not adequate housing
*   More people are ecming susceptible to natural disasters as a result of growth and urbanization, and disastrous outcomes are likely to increase unless improved ways of migration, forecasting, and warning, community preparedness, and resilience are developed
    *   Solutions to disasters include help from international agencies, national governments, NGOs, and local communities

Why there is an increasing impact



*   An explanation for the increasing impact of geophysical events is that there are increasingly more people in high-risk areas
*   Human activities may be changing the climate and land use, leading to greater impacts of landslides
*   The concentration of people in large urban areas, combined with **environmental degradation** makes communities more vulnerable
    *   Destruction of **mangrove swamps** in Sri Lanka increased the vulnerability of coastal communities to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami
    *   In Limbe in SW Cameroon, shanty towns have been built at the base of slopes that have been made unstable by undercutting, leading to an increase in landslides in the rainy season


### Impacts of extreme disasters



*   Global economic crises
*   Deaths
*   Possible destruction of megacities
*   Environmental refugees
*   Environmental degradation
*   Disruption of global food supplies
*   Disruption of transport and communications
*   Pollution 
*   Climate stress

Tackling global problems



*   Montreal Protocol, Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement, the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA)


### Identifying areas at risk



*   It is not possible to communicate with those who need to know
*   Not possible to predict the exact timing, impact, and magnitude of an earthquake


### Population growth and urban growth



*   The world’s population is expected to reach 11.2 billion by 2050, concentrated in India, Nigeria, Pakistan, DRC, Ethiopia, URT, USA, Indonesia, and Uganda; most of these are LICs, posing challenges of eradicating poverty and inequality, combating hunger and malnutrition, to provide adequate housing


### Predictions, forecasts, and warnings


#### Preparing



*   Better forecasting and warning
*   Improved building design and location
*   Establishing emergency procedures


#### Monitoring



*   Small scale ground surface changes
*   Small-scale uplift or subsidence
*   Ground tilt
*   Changes in rock stress
*   Micro-earthquake activity
*   Anomalies in the earth's magnetic field
*   Changes in radon gas concentration
*   Changes in electrical resistivity in rocks


### Earthquake prediction



*   Example: **Oarfish** in Japan, coming to the surface is an indication of a forthcoming earthquake
