# Population and economic development patterns


## Factors affecting population distribution



*   **Distance from the sea**: 75% of the population live within 1,000 km of the sea, and more people are moving towards the sea
    *   For example, in China, through internal migration, between **1990 and 95**,** 10 million** people moved **from rural areas to urban areas closer to the coast**, as these places had more **opportunities** [see CS below].
*   **Altitude**: 85% live less than 500 m. Higher altitudes do not provide suitable conditions for living as they are often too cold for crops to grow
    *   Apart from certain farmers such as hill sheep farms, most farmers are at lower altitudes as fruits stay ripe for longer, and the conditions are better for livestock.
    *   People in poverty are sometimes forced to live on mountains, which are more prone to the geophysical hazard of mass movements (landslides, mud slides, and they cannot move because of the lack of possibilities)
*   <10% in the **southern hemisphere**: there is a higher proportion of land above the equator (around 67%)
    *   Furthermore, there are deserts such as the Australian Outback and the Antarctic region, which do not provide suitable conditions
    *   The desert is too hot and contains various species of venomous spiders.
*   **Fertile soils**: they are better for farmers as they provide more nutrients for crops
    *   The most preferred areas include areas such as the **Nile valley** as the river floodplains provide alluvial soil, along with a natural source of water.


## Population distribution at a national scale


### China



*   There is uneven distribution: 11% of the population live on 0.5% of the land, and 50% live on 8.2% of the land because of the **physical geography**; less than 4% of the population live inland in places such as Tibet and Inner Mongolia
    *   Only a small amount of the land is able to provide for rainfed agriculture, and much of the other land is too steep to dry/arid for agriculture, such as the east of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau 
*   Through internal migration, between **1990 and 95**,** 10 million** people moved **from rural areas to urban areas closer to the coast**, as these places had more **opportunities**
    *   There is a higher number of people living along the coasts of the South China Sea owing to the number of fish
    *   More people move to Shanghai as it is more developed, in search of better jobs
*   A good place includes the **Sichuan Basin**, near Chengdu, although it is in the center (anomaly)
    *   It is known as the ‘rice bowl’ of China
    *   It has a population of **171 million** owing to the fertile soils and rainfall sufficient for growing rice
    *   It also contains the ‘Sichuan Basin’, or Hongpen for water for irrigation, allowing the economy to be self-sufficient
*   Mega-regions are being created, which hold megacities and millionaire cities, such as the **Liaoning mega-region** with around **30 million inhabitants**
    *   These mega-regions are more concentrated towards the east of the country, reinforcing the inequality between east and west
*   However, in 2020, people are expected to migrate towards the eastern, coastal regions of China (rural to urban internal migration) – it is predicted that there will be over 350 million urban inhabitants by 2020.


#### **Internal migration**



*   Since 1978, **160 million** migrants left rural areas to seek work in urban areas – this was because the wages in urban areas were **40% higher**
*   It is good for the economy and beneficial to migrants (higher wages and workforce, higher LE in urban areas), although the environment is affected with increasing levels of air pollution
    *   For example, the usage of coal is an issue as it releases dangerous sulfur dioxide and smog
    *   Furthermore, in 2012, the waste generation in China was 300 million tonnes, along with 2.3 million tonnes of electronic waste owing to the enhanced economy and technological development.

Example: **Shenzhen** (in the south-east) was a settlement of a few thousand people and by 2010, its population had reached 12 million, and is predicted to reach 15 million by 2012



*   It is a megaregion due to the high population


### South Africa



*   Similar to China, South Africa has uneven population distribution due to internal migration
    *   **Gauteng**, an economic region, has a population density of **over 1,000/km<sup>2</sup>** while areas in the **Northern Cape Province** have densities of less than **5/km<sup>2</sup>**
    *   Only 65% of the population of **Gauteng** are born in the province, and the rest comprise of migrants and internal migrants.
*   **Durban** is the third most populated city in South Africa
    *   It has a higher population density of 2,600/km<sup>2</sup> as it has mineral resources including gold and diamonds
    *   In 2015, it was recognised as one of the **New7Wonders Cities**.
*   In SA, the population increases from the north-west to the south-east, reflecting partially the rainfall distribution


###### Internal migration



*   In 1950, internal economic migration took place from _ to _
*   The **apartheid movement** caused forced migration of the blacks
    *   Between 1948 and 94, National Party has political control of SA, and they forcibly moved 4 million blacks from “white areas”
    *   There were “influx controls”, restricting black people from entering white towns
    *   However, after 1994, blacks have migrated to larger cities such as **Cape Town** in search of better employment opportunities.


# The demographic transition model



*   It is a model used to describe the transition through which European countries has passed in the progression from an agrarian to a modern society. It has been applied to LICs and is used to predict the future population sizes and patterns.


## Applying the DTM to Europe


### Historically



*   It suggests that fertility decline is closely linked to socio-economic modernization such as literacy, and degree of urbanization. A study of the **Walloon** and **Flemish** communities in **Belgium** found examples of communities with similar characteristics ut with widely varying fertility rates, which showed that **culture** was a dominating factor. 
*   Evidence from the **European** **Fertility Project** shows that fertility transition occurs under a great diversity of socio-economic conditions, suggesting that **diffusion** within a specific cultural or linguistic region is dominant factors in the onset of the fertility transition.


### Future



*   Many developed countries currently have birth-rates below the replacement level
*   Some governments are also introducing pronatalist policies to counteract population decline
*   The low trend in the could be followed by an upward trends as women “catch-up” in producing missing births, although this hypothesis cannot be evaluated.


### The UK


#### Birth rate rising (1700–1840)



*   Improvements in recording births and deaths in the natural census in 1811
*   Early stages of industrialization, so strong economic advantages of having children as they could contribute to the family by working in factories and mines – incentive to produce more children 


#### Death rate rises slightly (1820–1840)



*   Fluctuating deaths in the 19th century as many diseases incurable and epidemics occurred periodically
*   Death rate peaks coincide with the two World Wars


#### Rise in birth rate in the (1950s)



*   In 1945–50, the birth rate peak corresponds to the post-war “baby boom” in Europe
*   Increasing number of working in the seventies, so the birth rate may have been elevated later by such women making  alate decision to have a family


### Developing countries

There is a pattern when applying the model to developing countries:



*   Mortality and transitions happen 3x or 4x faster usually: this is because:
    *    “imported” medical knowledge or technology rather than being dependent on internal advances,
    *    Role of the government, especially in China and Singapore, in promoting a decreased fertility
    *    Education programmes aimed at women have resulted in delayed marriage and first birthday as well as increased availability of contraception


# Megacities



*   A **megacity** is a city with a population exceeding 8 million, and one that has diversified in function
*   By 1990, there were 20 megacities, 14 in the developing world


## Problems



*   Lack of access to clean water, inadequate housing, harmful health effects of air pollution
*   In Jakarta, Indonesia, over 1 million people do not have access to piped water or to a well. Over-abstraction from the city’s aquifer has resulted in subsidence of many areas of the city (30% of the population depends on this). Despite attempts made the government to control vehicle emissions, the entire population of the city is still exposed to levels of particular exceeding the WHO.
*   In developing and developed countries, megacities exhibit social problems such as violence, drug abuse


## Factors affecting growth of megacities


### Colonial influences



*   Creation of coastal cities in previous non-urban areas by invaders
*   The Spanish and Portuguese created Lima and Buenos Aires which grew as Europeans flocked to the ‘new world’ to seek their fortunes, Rio de janeiro


### Ports and trading cities



*   Developed from the 1600 to the 1800s
*   Shanghai: export of cotton ,silk, textiles; Sa Paolo: coffee which stimulated rapid growth


### Reassignment of city as capital



*   Prior to the independence of Bangladesh, Dhaka was the eastern regional administration capital and old trade center
*   In 1950 the population of 430,000, and independence was gained in 1971, and in 1975 the population shut up to 2.3 million
*   Annual growth of 7.25%, predicted to be magaity by 2020


### Post independence policies frequently favored urban areas over rural



*   industrialization/import substitution became the dominant post independence development strategy sa terms of trade has begun to favor Britain and US
*   These industries drew labor from rural areas overseas


### Post-war modernization and industrialization



*   The World Depresion of the 1930s following the Wall Street Crash and effects of WW2 encouraged industrialization in developing countries, particularly Latin AMerica
*   Industrialized nations needed manufacturing goods as their own factories were converted for war production, thus creating a ready market from Latin American exports, which in turn created wealth to back import substitution


### Declining mortality rates



*   Adult and infant mortality rates had fallen in both urban and rural areas as a result of modern public health measures and imported measures
*   Developing countries were also able to reduce the rates as they could import technology and medical equipment to treat diseases
*   Urban population because to live longer, and rural to urban migration increases;


### Rural to urban migration



*   Classic push and pull factors related to lack of land, war, famine, higher standards of long and better access to series, training, and employment have been responsible for urban growth in all developing countries
*   Rural to urban migration accounted for 20% of the groht of Buenos Aires between 1940 and 1980


### Settlement laws



*   A China household registration system was enforced in 1050s which classified the urban population as Entitled and allowed access to subsidies and welfare to rural population as they were Non-Entitled
*   The Entitled urban section became very attractive where levels of consumption were 3 times higher than the countryside, so migration to the cities grew

## Case study: Mumbai/Bombay



*   Second largest city in India after Calcutta
*   The 2011 census states that the population was over 12 million
*   Was developed as a deep water port by East India Company and export channel for Indian textiles
    *   19th century: city grew as piracy suppressed, steamships arrived, and Western Ghats were crossed by rails in 1850s.
*   New industrial employment drew migrants from India, Europe, and Middle East
*   Mumbai currency accounts for **25%** of India's industrial output
    *   Many TNCs such as the **Tata Group** are based in Mumbai
    *   Mumbai is home to the **Bombay Stock Exchange**, the** Reserve Bank of India**, and **National Stock Exchange of India**
    *   It also contains India’s scientific and nuclear industries of atomic energy, such as the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)
*   However there are a significant number of slums: **9 out of the 12 million people** live in slums
    *   **Dharavi**, Asia’s greatest slum is found here where 77% of households have an average of 5.3 people/room
    *   The slum is a home to over **700,000 people** and only few people have jobs such as plumbing, and the largest industry is receding.
*   Service provision is inadequate, and pollution levels are high: 
    *   **2 M** people live with no sewage facilities
    *   Despite the number of people employed in recycling, **5,000 tonnes** of rubbish are produced everyday
    *   Sewage is not treated before dispersed in the Arabian Sea; industrial pollution blamed for increasing incidents of respiratory and skin disease
*   Most of the problems were caused by **rapid city growth**: 
    *   Poverty
    *   Unemployment and underemployment
    *   Limited access to healthcare and education
    *   Poor sanitation and electricity
    *   Diseases: up to **4,000 causes of diphtheria **and **typhoid** a day


# Forced migration



*   **Forced migration** is the movement of refugees and internally-displaced people (people displaced by natural/environmental disasters, famine, or development projects)
*   There are several types:
    *   **Conflict-induced displacement**: people forced to move due to armed conflict (civil war, violence, or persecution) on the basis of their nationality, race, religion, political opinion, or social group
    *   **Development-induced displacement**: people are forced to move as a result of large-scale infrastructure projects (dams, airports)
    *   **Disaster-induced displacement**: natural disasters resulting in large numbers of displaced people
*   There are different types of forced migrants:
    *   **Refugees**: a person residing outside his/her country of nationality, unable or unwilling to return because of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a political social group of political opinion
    *   **Asylum seekers**: a person who has left their country of origin in search of protection in another country
    *   **Internally displaced persons (IDPs)**: people who have been forced to flee their home suddenly or unexpectedly in large numbers as a result of armed conflict, internal strife, systematic violations of human rights, or natural or manmade disasters, and who are within the territory of their own country
    *   **Development displacees**: people compelled to move as a result of policies and projects to promote development
    *   **Environmental and disaster displacees**
    *   **Smuggled people**: people moved illegally for profit
    *   **Trafficked people**: people moved by deception and coercion for the purpose of exploitation and profit


## Case study: Forced migration in and from Syria



*   The repression of the ruling Assad regime and the emergence of the fundamentalist Islamic and group ISIS have led to the displacement of over 10 million people
*   The Syrian conflict began as a civil war, but extended to include parts of Iraq when ISIS declared Syria and Iraq an Islamic “caliphate”
*   Syrians near Damascus feared that government forces were being used on their own people, whereas in other parts of Syria, people feared that he would be killed, captured or forced to live under a severe and harsh Islamic rule


# Aging populations



*   Aging populations have both challenges and opportunities associated with them
*   The elderly make the “grey economy” and hae many firms (holiday companies, health care)
*   By 2035, the number of over 65s is expected to double to **1.3 billion**, from **7 to 14%** of the world's population
*   The shift to an increasing number of aged people is due to **high fertility levels** after WW2 and **health improvements** that are reducing death rates at older ages
*   Europe is currently the greatest continent with 23 of the world’s 25 oldest countries
*   The **older dependency ratios** (ODR) acts as an indicator of the balance between working age people and the older population that they must support


## Case study: Japan



*   Number of elderly in Japan has increased from **0.8 million in 1975 to 2.5 in 2000**
    *   Since 1975 the percentage of young people has gradually decreased
    *   26% of the Japanese population are aged over 65 years in age, creating a burden on pension funds and social welfare programs
*   There are many causes for this:
    *   **High life expectancy**, which was 85 in 2016; and the overall population is shrinking due to lower fertility rates, and the aging population is rapidly increasing through improved nutrition, advanced medical and pharmacological technologies to prevent diseases
        *   There was also massive economic growth following WW2, leading to longer lifespans (from 52 to 85 in 2016)
    *   **Lower fertility rates**: in 2016, the TFR was 1.4 children per woman, due to the “_tempo_ effect”, which is caused by the timing of births, and most women are being married later, after being educated
*   The high elderly population creates many problems:
    *   Inadequate nursing facilities for the elderly as one doctor has to support many more patients
        *   This has also lead to the creation of nursing homes and adult daycare centers (and home health programs): Japan closes **400 primary and secondary schools** per year, converting some of them to care centers for the elderly
    *   Depletion of the labor force as there are more elderly and less young, so one worker has to support more older people
        *   This further leads to a **deterioration of the economy**, as the silver population grows
        *   The population pyramid has been inverted, with a bulge at the top, leading to the narrow base of young people having to provide care and support for a larger older cohort: the dependency ratio is increasing
        *   There are 125 jobs for every 100 job seekers as of 2015
    *   Many elderly live alone and isolated, leading unnoticed deaths (solitary death) (for many weeks)


## Case study: China’s one-child policy


## Case study: Japan’s pro-natalist policies



*   Child Benefit Act of 1972: gave parents a 3000 yen contribution for starting a family
    *   Aided in the financial security and well-being of children


## Case study: Literacy and gender equality policies in Kerala


# Anti-trafficking policies



*   Increase awareness of traffickers and the problems associated
*   Design policies to prevent trafficking: this includes up-to-date registration of births and migration into an area
*   Allow trade union to protect rights in order to reduce trafficking
*   Criminalise trafficking: jin the 2003 UN protocol to Prevent, Support, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children
*   However, it can be difficult to manage trafficking
    *   Areas such as Africa and the Middle East have such large populations, so the number of people unprotected is very large
    *   Some (large) populations only have partial coverage
*   There are many populations at risk of trafficking
    *   Refugees and migrants: the overburdened asylum systems in Europe have provided opportunities for traffickers to continue to operate
    *   LGBTI people and religious minorities
    *   People with disabilities
    *   Stateless people


# The demographic dividend



*   The **demographic dividend** refers to a bulge in the number of adults in a population, occurring when the fertility rates decline, allowing faster economic growth
*   The lag between fertility provides a bulge in the population that surges through age groups 
*   This bulge increases the dependency ratio, and then eventually enters the work force
*   The demographic dividend provides many **benefits**
    *   Increased labor supply
    *   Healthier women as the **TFR reduces** and because there are fewer societal and economic pressures
        *   This allows parents to invest more resources per child, leading to better health and educational outcomes
        *   Family planning helps delay to first pregnancy, thus improving the health of both the mother and the child
        *   Educated women are more likely to work outside home, increasing the size of the labor force and their potential for economic development
    *   **Inverses** **GDP per capita** as the workforce increases
    *   More **tax revenue** for the government
    *   Increases savings as the number of dependents decline
*   **Achieving** the demographic dividend
    *   Countries must substantially lower both BR and child DR
    *   Focus on producing women with voluntary family planning information and services
        *   **1 in 4** women in developing countries wants avoid being pregnant or delay childbirth but are not using modern family planning methods
        *   Thailand invested in voluntary family planning, contraceptive use increased,leading to a reduced TFR from 5.5 to 2.2
    *   Invest in child survival and health programmes
    *   Commit to volnaretry family planning needs of both married and unmarried growth
    *   Prioritizing education, especially secondary education for girls
*   However, certain problems occur **after** the demographic dividend
    *   The dependency ratio rises again as the population cohort created grows old and retires
    *   A disproportionate number of old people rely upon a smaller generation 
    *   This is seen dramatically in **Japan**, with an aging population


## Case study: South Korea’s demographic dividend



*   SK made a rapid transition from reducing the TFR between 1960–90 through investing in health programmes, education and economic policies to create infrastructure and manufacturing
*   SK followed an aggressive population policy
    *   **Investment in health centers** to provide a range of services including family planning
        *   Field workers visited homes and provided family planning information and methods
    *   People saw that having fewer children improved life, and the fertility dropped from 5.4 to 2.9 to 1.2 per woman
    *   The governments also focused on **education** between the 1960–80s
        *   A “production-oriented” education would provide people with skills and knowledge to achieve economic development
    *   At the same time, the **economic plans** were comprehensive
        *   In the 50s, SK’s economic plans were based heavily on farming, fishing, and was weak
        *   Improved relations with Japan led to investment capital that strengthened agricultural fishing and manufacturing industries, including shipping 
        *   The government also addressed unemployment through rural construct that provided minimum wages for workers involved in the construction of infrastructure including dams and roads
            *   This leads to the development of a national infrastructure and economic growth
