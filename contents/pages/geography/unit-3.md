# 3.1 Global trends in consumption


## Poverty reduction and the global middle class



*   Poverty reduction was a goal of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) between **2000 and 2015**, and was a success:
    *   1990: 50% of people in LICs lived on less than $1.25
    *   2015: only 14%
    *   The number of people living in extreme poverty fell from 1.9 B in 1990 to 836 M in 2015
*   At the same time, the number of people in the middle class tripled between **1990 and 2015** (people living on at leat $4/day)
    *   This is because of the increase in average incomes and the fall in the number of people living in absolute poverty
    *   Thi is a good economic feature as it helps increase the sales of goods such as phones, cars, electronic goods: the sales of cars increased by over **800%** since 2009
    *   However, in the 1980s Brazil the middle class accounted for less than 30% of the population since the 1960s, unlike South Korea, where the middle class accounted for 50%
*   Hover, not all the middle class has **economic security** as many people on incomes of over $4/day remain vulnerable to un(der)employment
    *   **800 M people** still live in extreme poverty including workers, living in unsafe conditions
    *   People are also disadvantages on accounts of race and gender: in Latin America, women are more likely to live in poverty than men
        *   The proportion has increased from 108 women to 100 men in 1997 to 117 women to 100 men in 2012
    *   Globally, **75%** of men are part of global labor force, but only **50%** of women are, and women earn on average **25%** less than men


## Global consumption of resources


### Ecological footprints



*   An **ecological footprint** is the hypothetical area of land required by a society, group, or individual to fulfill all their resource needs and assimilate their wastes
*   A country **increases** the ecological footprint through
    *   Relying on fossil fuels
    *   Higher levels of imported resources (higher transport)
    *   Meat-rich diets
    *   High technology and energy use
    *   Large population
*   A country **reduces** the ecological footprint through
    *   Reducing the amount of resources used
    *   Recycling and reusing
    *   Improving resource use and efficiency
    *   Improve technology to increase carrying capacity
    *   Technology to improve and increase land use
    *   Reducing population (anti-natalist policies)


### Ecological footprints in HICs and LICs



*   HICs, in general, have higher disposable incomes which means that consumption and demand for energy resources are high, and their resource use is more wasteful
    *   Meat-eating diets are more prevalent in HICs, where **30%** of the diet is based off of animal protein
        *   Meat-eating diets in general use more land than the vegetarian diet as animals use **90%** of the for they eat for other processes such as respiration
*   People in LICs, by contrast, have less to spend
    *   Resources are often recycled through the informal economy
*   GHG emissions from agriculture also affect the total footprint
    *   According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the agriculture sector emist between 5.1 and 6.1 B tonnes of GHG annually, about **11%** of the total GHG emissions
*   Populations more **dependent on fossil fuels** have higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions


## Patterns and trends in water availability and consumption



*   **Embedded/virtual water** refers to the way in which water is transferred from one country to another through its exports
*   Water is unevenly distributed: about **780 M** people do not have access to clean water, and this number will increase in 2015, when the world population will likely reach around **9 B**
*   HICs maintain or increase their consumption of resources such as water, although an increasing portion of this water is embedded in agricultural and manufactured products
*   Land grabs and transfer lead to loss of water
    *   **Saudi Arabia** cut production of cerails at home by **12%**, and with a series of land grabs, produced the cereals it needed in parts of Africa
*   Various trends **increase** the pressure on water
    *   Population growth, expected to reach **9 B **by **2050**
    *   Growing middle class: increasing affluence leads to greater water consumption (showers, baths, gardening)
    *   Growth of **tourism** and recreation (golf courses, water parks, pools)
    *   Urbanization: urban areas require significant water investment to get water to people and to remove waste products hygienically
    *   Climate change


## Patterns and trends in the availability of land and food consumption



*   The food intake has **increased** in mainly the NICs, and is **constant** in LICs such as countries in Southern Africa
*   HICs are adopting a more varied diet including meats
*   The fast-food industry is growing in HICs and LICs as their demand increases
    *   Food demand is inelastic as a person’s food consumption only increases up to a certain point
*   Since 1961, the total fish supply and consumption increases by about 3.6% per year while the world’s population has grown by 1.8% over the same period
    *   Production from the world’s ocean fisheries has levelled off since the 1970s, largely because of overfishing
*   Growth rates of food production and crop yields have been falling
    *   This can be due to natural hazards (fires, floods, draughts), climate change, and use of land to produce biofuels
    *   Food shortages also lead to riots in Indonesia, Egypt, and North Africa
*   Ways of increasing crop production:
    *   Expanding the area farmed
    *   Multicropping, often using irrigation
    *   Using high-yielding varieties or genetically modified organisms


### Patterns and trends in availability and consumption of energy



*   Energy insecurity has risen for a number of reasons
    *   Increased demand, especially from NICs
    *   Decreased reserves as supplies are used up
    *   Global warming and natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina (2005) increased awareness of the misuse of energy resources
*   A diversified energy mix offers the most energy security
*   The Middle East controls 50% of the world’s remaining oil reserves and Saudi Arabia controls 20%
    *   USA consumes 200 M barrels/day but possess less than 2% of the world’s oil reserves, so it has to source much of its oil from overseas, notably the middle east
    *   This gives the Middle East economic and political advantage, and countries that want oil have to stay on friendly terms with them
    *   Countries that depend on their region for oil need to
        *   Ensure political stability of the Middle East
        *   Maintain good political links with the Middle East
        *   Involve the Middle East in economic cooperation


# 3.2 Impacts of changing trends in resource consumption

[Never completed this]


## Case study: resource security in the Hindu Kush region



*   South Asia has 3% of the world’s land, but around 25% of the world’s population
*   Food, emgy, and water security are therefore important, however, around 20% of the population lack access to safe drinking water


### Nexus



*   The nexus approach to food, water, and energy is an integrated method for achieving security in all three elements
*   The ecosystem services provided by the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH( region are vital for the security of all three sectors (1.3 B people rely on water from the HKH region)


### Problems



*   Rapid population growth, rapid urbanization, industrialization, uncertainties of climate change
*   Thee changes lead to increased demand and pressure on resources
