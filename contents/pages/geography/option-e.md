# E.1 Changing leisure patterns



*   **Leisure** is any freely chosen activity or experience that takes place on non-work time, including sport, recreation, and tourism
*   **Recreation** is a leisure-time activity undertaken voluntarily and for enjoyment, including individual pursuits, organized outings and events, and non-paid (non-professional) sports
*   **Sport** is a physical activity involving events and competitions at the national and international scale with professional participants
*   **Tourism** is travel away from home for at least one night for the purpose of leisure
*   The range of leisure activities is expanding rapidly with the development of societies to support enthusiasts
*   Leisure time has grown because of a
    *   Reaction in the length of the working day and week
    *   Increase in wages
    *   Increase in disposable income
    *   Growth of leisure activities
    *   More early retirement
    *   Increase in self-employment or flexitime
    *   Developments in technology (such as washing machines), giving people more time and opportunities for leisure
*   Men usually have more leisure time than females due to household and parenting responsibilities, although this is changing
*   LICs have less disposable income, and therefore a lower change in engaging in leisure activities
*   As LE increases, pursuing leisure activities is more important as adults benefit from it physically, socially, emotionally, and culturally


## Categorization of tourism and sports



*   Primary tourist resources are the pre-existing attractions for tourism or recreation (climate, scenery, wildlife, indigenous people, cultural heritage sites)


## Case study: changes in China’s leisure activities



*   In 2015,
    *   22% of people spend 1–2 hours/day on leisure activities
    *   16% spend 3–4
    *   12% spend 4–5%, the rest spend more than 5 hours
*   About ⅓ of people spend their leisure time reading and ⅙ watching TV, partially because China is becoming more rich, and the middle classes are also growing
*   There are various leisure activities
    *   ⅓ of chinese adults spend time on the internet through mobile phone/laptop
    *   Shopping is enjoyed by women mostly
    *   Sports include table tennis and badminton: there are various free badminton courts in sporting clubs
    *   Other activities include chess, cards, dancing, and jogging, in chinese parks
*   An increasing amount of the middle class are taking part in leisure and sport
    *   **33.9%** of the population between 7 and 70 exercise regularly and **60.7%** of the urban population go to sports clubs to engage in fitness activities
*   However, many do not have time to engage in these activities
    *   For example, migrants work long hours, and are tired (physically and mentally), so they do not taking part in sports and other leisure activities
    *   They do not have much disposable income, and if they do, they send it to their family or abroad
    *   Some do have free time, but spend it studying
    *   In 2015, around **227 M** migrant workers were in the workforce
*   Children's leisure activities are also changing
    *   The most popular activities used to be homework, extra reading, and academic training programmes
    *   After 1995, Saturday schools ceased, so leisure activities and vacations were more orgazies, and summer camps were started
*   China's leisure activities are getting more similar to that of the Western world including USA
    *   In 2016, the Wanda group opened **Wanda city** in **Nanchang**, which is rival to Disney world
    *   In 2016, Disney also opened a resort in Shanghai, **Mickey Mao**, and is expected to become the world's most visited park with **50 M** guests/year


## Cast study: sports participation in the UK



*   Participation in sport is greater among younger people, those with a car, students, and those in higher income bands
    *   Those most likely **not** to participate in sport include those aged over 67, black, minority, lone pensioners, local authority tenants, those with no qualifications, sick, and disabled
    *   People who participate in sports as children are more likely to participate as adults
*   The most popular sports vary by sex
    *   Women: swimming, heath, fitness, cycling
*   It also varies by personality
    *   Some people take more risk, and eniy sports like rock-climbing, and mountaineering


# E.2 Tourism and sport the local and national scale


## Case study: national sports league, Rugby in South Africa



*   Rugby is one of SA’s biggest sports along with soccer and cricket
*   The **Currie Cup**
    *   The currie cup was the first rugby competition in SA in 1892
    *   The format varies from year to year and the finals were held intermittently until 1968, after which the finals had become an annual event
    *   Up to 2015, the most successfully province in the history of the Currie Cup was the Western province (Western Cape) with 33 titles, followed by the Blue Bulls with 23 titles
    *   Sunce rugby become a professional sport in the early 1990s, no single team has dominated the cup
    *   For many years, the biggest rivalry in South African rugby was between Western Province and the Blue Bulls
        *   During the early to mid-1990s, there was a three-way rivalry between Natal, the Lions, and Western Province
    *   The **Currie Cup** takes place yearly between July and October, with 14 teams
*   The **Vodacom Cup**
    *   The Vodacom Cup has become an important competitor on the SA rugby calendar
    *   It takes place at the same time as the **Super 14** competition, starting in late February, and finishing in mid-May, thus creating a platform for young players who might otherwise not get a chance to play for a team
    *   This has also allowed people from disadvantaged backgrounds to play
*   Most supporters are within the province, although many of the fanbase has moved for university/home, or marriage


## Case study: the Glastonbury rural Festival



*   The **Glastonbury Festival** is the largest open-air music festival in Europe, and is globally recognized
*   It is **cultural tourism** that embraces many activities: visiting **heritage sites, exploring historical and religious festivals, and attending music and fine arts drama festivals**
*   Festival goers are attracted by the opportunity to see a particular type of performance or particular performer and to be a part of the festival cultures: this also presents an opportunity to socialize with friends


### Development



*   The festival began as the **Pilton Pop Festival** in 1970, and has been held every year, except for 2001 since its inauguration
*   It is an open air festival which covers approximately 800 acres, and the site now accommodates 250,000 people


### Impacts of the festival



*   Economic impacts include
    *   The Mendip local authority area, Shepton Mallet, Street and Wells, and their rural hinterland, Bristol and Bath, the South-West region, and the UK all benefit financially from the festival
    *   Each visitor spends an average £293, and this income makes contributions to charities such as Water Aid, Greenpeace, and Oxfam
        *   The money is also used to support local projects such as the provision of school and sporting facilities
    *   However, there are a number of negative impacts too, such as drug, substance abuse, and theft, owing to the increasing amount of tourists
*   Growth of Glastonbury
    *   The festival is now welcomed by the local community as it is associated with rebellion and hippie culture
    *   Civic pride is derived from hosting a global event
    *   It offers local people an employment opportunity
*   There are also various environmental impacts
    *   Air pollution
        *   CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increase dramatically during June on the 3-day festival
        *   Car transport is popular due to its flexibility, although attempts to encourage supporters to use public transport are being made
        *   Green coaches using environmentally acceptable fuels are also encouraged
    *   Waste disposal
        *   Waste creation is one of the biggest problems
        *   Waste mainly consists of human waste, plastic bottles, and tents
        *   Many tourists leave behind tents: ⅙ tents were left behind in 2006
    *   Noise pollution
        *   This causes a disturbance to the locals
    *   Provision of resources
        *   Energy, water, and food need to be supplied


## Case study: Killarney National Park, Ireland



*   The region relies heavily on tourism as a source of employment and revenue as the amount of paid holidays, disposable income, and transport infrastructure has increased, so the number of tourists visiting has also increased


### Location



*   One of the most visited tourists venues in Ireland
*   Over a million visitors travel to Kerry each year, bringing an estimated £160 M to the area
*   Resident population of 14,000 with over 4.000 tourist rooms
*   The scenic quality is made of a variety of physical and human landscapes including the three lakes of Killarney, secluded lake shores, limestone cliffs, rocks and islands, waterfalls and rapidly flowing rivers, rugged sandstone mountains, eroded valleys, native wood oaklands, and historical buildings and ruins


### National park



*   The Killarney National Park is managed by the Office of Public WOrks (OPW) and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve by the UNESCO
*   National Parks in Ireland are areas that exist to “_exist to conserve natural plant and animal communities and scenic landscapes which are both extensive and of national importance and, under conditions compatible with that purpose, to enable the public to visit and appreciate them_” 
*   The main objective of the National Park are to
    *   Conserve nature and other significant features and qualities
    *   Encourage public appreciation of the heritage and the need for conservation
    *   Develop a harmonious relationship between the park and the community
    *   Enable to park to contribute to science through environmental monitoring and research


### Management strategy



*   The Killarney park does not comprise a self-contained ecological unit as it is influenced by changes and developments that take place in the surrounding areas
*   There are four main zones
    *   Natural zone: nature conservation is the primary objective
    *   Cultural zone: conservation of airworthy features resulting from human activities is the primary objective
    *   Intensive management zone: basic park objectives other than conservation are emphasized
    *   Resource restoration zone


### Challenges



*   Control and eradication of the Rhododendron population is the biggest challenges
    *   Up to 900 ha of the park’s 11,200 ha of native woodland are infested


# E.3 Tourism and sport at the international scale


## Case study: Machu Picchu, a heritage tourism



*   Machu Picchu was a center of worship
*   It is a World Heritage Site and in 2007, was selected as one of the New7Wonders of the work
*   It is one of the most attractive cultural sites in Latin America to tourists all around the world
*   However, there are many problems in managing tourism pressures
    *   UNESCO authorities are worried about **deforestation**, the risk of **landslides**, uncontrolled **urban development**, and illegal access to the sanctuary
    *   UNESCO has considered adding the site to the endangered list, but has not so far
    *   The Ministry of Culture is thinking of limiting the day pass to three hours, and limiting the time spent at each point
    *   Currently, only **400 people per day** are allowed to climb **Huayna Picchu**, and there is a limit of **500 daily permits** for the **Inca trail**
    *   There are plans for roads and cable cars to access Machu Picchu, apart from only the railways
*   New regulations have been put in place
    *   Visitors need to be organized in groups of at most 20 people for easier management
    *   Guides will have to wear uniforms with clearly visible credentials
    *   Visitors are prevented from leaving an organized group and joining another
    *   Time limit of 3–5 minutes to stop and appreciate Machu Picchu’s significant and sacred points of interest inlucid the **Intihuatana**, and the **Temple of the Condor**, to prevent bottleneck traffic jams
    *   Signs that say “Keep Moving”
*   However, tour operators are firmly against the new restrictions
*   Since 2011, the daily average number of visitors at Machu Picchu has far exceeded the daily limit of 2,500 as agreed to by Peru and the UNESCO


## Case study: role of TNCs


### Hilton Worldwide



*   Founded in 1919 by Conrad Hilton
*   Has over **4600 hotels** in **100 countries** worldwide
*   Largest hotel chain in the world with over **750000 rooms**

*   Credited with the development of the first airport hotel in San Francisco in 1949
*   Number of brands including the Conrad Hotels, Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts
*   Employs over **160000 people** worldwide


### Thomas Cook Group



*   Tourism TNC that has diversified
*   Founded in 1841 as transport company for the UK
*   Introduced “circular notes”, which became traveller's cheques
*   Company also involved in military transport and postal service
*   In the UK, Thomas Group became a “vertically integrated” company providing air transport, hotels, resorts, cruise lines, and tour operators
*   Employs over **20000 people** worldwide
*   Nearly **3000** **stores**, **97 aircraft**, and **20 million customers per year**
*   Thomas Cook was a sponsor of the London 2012 Olympic Games


## Case study: small island developing states, The Maldives



*   Consists of 1,190 tiny islands, **200** of which are inhabited by the population of **300000**
*   Tropical monsoon climate, hot and humid conditions, dry from October to April
*   **400000** tourists visit annually


### Economic importance



*   Accents for 28% of the Maldives’ GDP and more than 60% of its foreign exchange
*   Over 90% of the government tax comes from import duties
*   Tourism has created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities, and the multiplier effect
*   Fishing used to be the prime industry, but tourism has recently assumed a greater importance
*   Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the economy, as they are constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor
*   Industry , consisting of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts accounted for only 7% of the GDP in 2009
*   Most staple foods must be imported


### Vulnerability to external shocks



*   Tourist demand and revenue grew rapidly between 1990 and 2009, at an annual rate of 5%, but the rate has fallen and is predicted to average 2% between 2010 and 2020
*   The Maldives are vulnerable to external schosck of human and natural activity
    *   Sea-level rise is a threat as the Maldives is only 1.5 m above sea-level; it is the lowest country on the planet
        *   Sea-level has increased by around 20 cm since the 1990s
    *   Tsunamis, as the Maldives are in a tectonically active zone
        *   Badly affected by the Asian tsunami of December 2004, which left 100 dead and caused $300 M of property damage
        *   This caused the GDP to contract by 4.6% in 2005, although reconstruction was rapid
    *   The world economic recession of 2008 caused a stagnation for all sectors


### Vulnerability to internal limitations


#### Depletion of resources



*   The average tourist consumes more water and energy than the average Maldivian
*   Almost all water is produced by desalination, which is very expensive
*   Groundwater supplies are running short and often contaminated by sewage or saltwater
*   There are no economic minderson the Maldives, and the agricultural potential is low


#### Pollution



*   Solid and liquid waste production from tourists are high and matches their consumption
*   Solid waste is either dumped in poorly managed landfill sites, incinerated or sunbed at sea, all three possessed being unsustainable


### Respond to threats


#### Environment



*   New tourist sites must undergo an environmental impact assessment to measure potential construction to carrying capacity for the area, and developers must produce a mitigation plan
*   To combat poor waste management, incinerators have been installed
    *   Sewage disposal through soak-pits into aquifers is discouraged, and all new resort developments must now have their own waste-water treatment plants
    *   The installation of desalination plants has substantially reduced the stress on the natural aquifer


#### Economy



*   The Maldivian government aims to diversify the economy beyond tourism and fishing, and encourage linkage between tourism and other sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and transport
*   Some aims include reforming the public finance, encouraging foreign investment in the development of new resorts, broadening the tourism market by promoting domestic tourism and attracting visitors from China and India
*   The goal is to increase employment, which is problematic given the limited resource base of the Maldives


## Cast study: London 2012 Olympic Games



*   They were held in London, and considered a great success
    *   Helped regereate the poorest areas and derelict land
    *   Created **12000** new jobs
        *   More than **46000** people worked in the Olympic Park and Village, **10%** of whom were previously unemployed
    *   **£17 B** spend on upgrading infrastructure
    *   **2800** new homes built
    *   Lead to a **1.2%** reduction in unemployment levels

    *   The Games encouraged developments in the Eastend of London, such as Westfield shopping center, employing people in the process
    *   Women and black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people found employment in construction jobs
        *   The “Women into Construction” project funded by the London Development Agency and constructions schools recruited and placed 266 women directly with Olympic Park contractors
*   There were **government investments** too
    *   The UK government invested **£30 M** to transform the Olympic site into the “Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park”, which includes housing, new schools, health centers, business space, and sports avenues
    *   This involved converting the Olympic Village into more than **2800** flats with additional new neighborhoods containing **11000** residents, ⅓ which were affordable housing
    *   **Transport for London** invested **£6.5 M** in transport infrastructure in preparation for the 2012 games
*   The main aims of the Games were:
    *   To regenerate and transform London’s poorest areas (East End, Westfield)
    *   To create a Games for the world, reflecting on London’s diversity
    *   To create a legacy for east London
